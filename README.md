HackerTracker iOS
=================

HackerTracker iOS is a re-implementation/re-imagining of HackerTracker Android as created by shortxstack in Swift for use on iOS.

HackerTracker iOS is an information guide for security conferences, including DEF CON (defcon.org).

Speakers, events, contests, vendors, parties and other con info at your fingertips.

No internet connection required (unless you want to sync your DB with changes from DEF CON central). This is highly recommended as changes happen up-to and during the conference.
