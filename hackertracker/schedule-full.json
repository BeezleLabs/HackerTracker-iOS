As fantastic as the BeyondCorp papers are, it can be a bit daunting to take concepts from it and build something real.\n\nThe SSH protocol in particular was of interest to us given how many times we use it on a daily basis, but aside from some comments in the source code for the Chrome Secure Shell extension, there wasn't much to go on.\n\nIn this talk we'll provide an in-depth look at how we built an SSH WebSockets proxy that natively supports the relay protocol built into the Chrome Secure Shell extension.

      "description" : "Network accessible medical devices are ubiquitous in today's clinical environment. These devices can be of great aid to healthcare professionals in assessing, treating and monitoring a patient's condition. However, they can also fall victim to a number of systemic vulnerabilities that can expose personal health information or PHI, compromise the integrity of patient data in transit, and affect the availability of the devices themselves.\n\nThis talk looks at the methodology and approach to penetration testing of modern medical devices. It will provide an overview of the various stages of a medical device assessment, including discovery and analysis of a device's remote and local attack surface, reverse engineering and exploitation of proprietary network protocols, vulnerability discovery in network services, compromising supporting systems, attacking common wireless protocols, exploitation of hardware debug interfaces and bus protocols and assessing proprietary wireless technologies.\n\nIt will also cover a number of real world vulnerabilities that the speaker has discovered during medical device penetration testing assessments. These include weak cryptographic implementations, device impersonation and data manipulation vulnerabilities in proprietary protocols, unauthenticated database interfaces, hardcoded credentials/keys and other sensitive information stored in firmware/binaries and the susceptibility of medical devices to remote denial of service attacks.\n\nThe talk will conclude with some suggestions on how some of the most common classes of medical device vulnerabilities might be remediated by vendors and also how hospitals and other healthcare providers can defend their medical devices in the meantime.",

      "description" : "Pentesters are tired of breaking things, writing a report, and walking away. Security teams are caught in a backlog that prevents them from ever staying ahead. Developers curse security for slowing them down. How can we address these seemingly incompatible and insurmountable issues in an organization, especially at scale? The answer to this may be found in a practice called “DevSecOps” that has been gaining momentum in large organizations that need to move fast and ensure a high level of security across their applications and operations. It is a practice that attempts to address all of these issues through two core principles- automation and education. Using experience gained from working with several large fortune 500 companies, this talk will cover the basics of DevSecOps, and dive into specific tools and processes that organizations of any size can implement to immediately improve their speed of delivery while maintaining a strong and measurable security baseline.",

      "description" : "For someone who works with Wireshark on a daily basis, dealing with different protocols at varying layers in the OSI model, and writing custom display filters for multifarious purposes and scenarios, will soon realize that Wireshark doesn't provide the management interface necessary to do all of that in a structured and standardized way. Thus, why I'm presenting SPF (ShellPcapFication), a shell framework that provides a sophisticated abstraction layer for TShark (console-based version of Wireshark) and Windows command shell interpreter. SPF features a custom, unique and simple declarative language called Eros that consists of only two constructs, four keywords, three Input operators, auxiliary logic, a function call operator, an INSERT statement, a specifier, and an include preprocessing directive. Additionally, a set of built-in helper commands are also provided by SPF to simplify interaction with Eros in a dynamic way.\n\nIn this talk, I'll address the internals of SPF framework, its features, how it works, how to write constructs for it, and how SPF can be used to help achieve the following:\n\n\t+ The democratization of writing and sharing a standardized set of constructs based on Eros language\n\t+ The capability to use different constructs as building blocks to form complex operations + Simplification of repetitive tasks\n\t+ Rich shell functionality\n\t+ Automation of Exploit Kit detection\n\t+ Protocol specific features/fields extraction\n\t+ Building self-contained and easy to manage self-explanatory units/constructs\n\t+ Functioning as a signature detection system (based on TShark powerful protocol dissectors)",

But does our military have the capabilities to protect vital national interests in cyber? The growth of the Internet in our globally connected world has meant that tools for cyber are constantly changing. Accordingly, do we have the capacity to gain the advantages needed to out-hack our adversaries in this domain? In this talk, we provide a relatively simple framework for different types of innovation (disruptive, breakthrough, sustaining, and incremental) in order to find better solutions to malicious cyberattacks. By doing so, we promote how “inside-the-box” thinking can help successfully defend cyberspace.",

      "description" : "WordPress currently runs a large part of the internet ecosystem. Most companies use it in some shape or form of its web presence as a company blog, website, forum etc. The bad guys have kept pace with the development of the core product and have constantly demonstrated new ways of identifying vulnerabilities on the platform, exploiting weaknesses and using the exploited infrastructure for fun and profit.\n\nWith more and more companies moving towards agile technologies and a DevOps culture it has been a challenge for the security teams to keep pace with the constant changes in their infrastructure. It has been difficult for the security teams to review each line of code and perform penetration test for every new feature that makes it to production. The talk discusses ways of managing the pace of software development changes for security teams and following an agile strategy to allow them to stay ahead of vulnerabilities/bugs in daily changes of production code and build better detection on their WordPress infrastructure.\n\nWe have been witnessing more of the web infrastructure moving towards API driven capabilities and same has been the story for WordPress providing leverage for attackers to use automated techniques.\n\nThe talk focuses on securing programmatic access to WordPress APIs, understanding its weaknesses and how attackers have been exploiting it with the help of major botnet networks. We would deep dive for learning about the techniques attackers/botnets have been using to do initial recon followed by exploitation on WordPress sites. This talk would share trends of how the attack space has looked in the last few years and has been changing with time for WordPress. As part of the learning experience security teams would learn simple strategies to reduce the exposure of their WordPress infrastructure to such attacks and stay a step ahead of the bad guys.",

      "description" : "Many cybersecurity experts have said for years that we need to do better whitelisting, and that relying on blacklisting and anomaly detection is not good enough anymore. Unfortunately, organizations often cannot technically implement the comprehensive security policies they want to (or should want to). This is because there are too many overlapping technical configs in too many places, and everything keeps changing dynamically. This is particularly hard for large, interconnected “IT landscapes” like IoT. We need better security policy automation tools that allow us to write policies in generic, simple terms, and automatically implement them, and update them if the IT landscape changes. This is of course easier said than done. In this talk we will present (and run a demo) of security policy automation we are developing as part of a current government R&D subcontract (across an interconnected medical device landscape and across an interconnected intelligent transport system). It allows to author generic policies, ingests numerous data sources, tests policies, generates technical policy configurations, and monitor. The presentation will explain technical approaches, benefits and challenges",

      "description" : "For an outsider, the world of cybersecurity and hacking can be complex and mystifying. People are intrigued and terrified by the “400 lb hacker.” With phishing and other forms of social engineering still being one of the most common root cause of breach, there is a need to empower a company's employees, especially the non-technical ones, to be able to defend and not fall prey to such attacks. Similarly, the increase in the amount of code being written along with the shortage of cybersecurity professionals calls for a need to train software developers in Security. Traditional methods of awareness including lectures, videos etc. have been ineffective in achieving this adequately. I claim this based on reports by organizations such as Experian, Ponemon etc. and the extensive internal research done at my current company. I present a novel system for cybersecurity training and awareness : Security Gamification including CTF ( Capture The Flags). The training emphasizes on a ‘no one left behind' principle in which all the employees at a company get trained in CyberSecurity defense.\n\nCTFs are online cybersecurity competitions that involve practical hands on training through Security puzzle solving. They are mostly played by current or aspiring Security professionals and have proven to be one of the best ways to learn about Security and defense. My training method is novel in that this is the first publicly released use of CTFs and Security puzzles to train developers and non-technical people. CTFs rely on the interactive ‘learning by doing' methodology which has proven to be more successful than the one-way incoming lecture style. We use this methodology to gamify the Security training for technical as well as nontechnical employees by varying the scopes and level of challenges. The idea is to help the participants learn how to defend by making them break or hack things in a controlled environment. It helps the participants defend better by getting into the attacker mindset, thereby de-mystifying the hacking world. Additionally, the healthy competition amongst employees, the fun puzzle based format and the chance to work in teams all provides exceptional learning opportunities.\n\nIn my presentation, I will also delve into the key take-aways for people interested in building a similar system at their respective companies. This detailed interaction will contain discussions about the reconnaissance of Security awareness at a company needed as step one of building this system. Then, it will go on to demo some example challenges for both developers as well as non-technical employees. I also plan to include a brief section about how to present it such that the employees and leadership are excited about it rather than seeing it as a burden.\n\nOne of the many appealing things about this system is its ability to effectively track and quantifiably measure the increase in Security awareness and defense capabilities over time. Starting from the reconnaissance phase, all the way to successfully completing the implementation and even after that, the system provides functionality of number of challenges solved, time taken, number of attempts etc. for each employee which can also be combined per team, per department or the whole company etc.",

      "description" : "Starting from Espionage and ending at OSINT, our data gathering techniques has been developed magnificently. In 90's, the security posture of national security, law enforcement agencies, Cyber Security agencies was totally different. At that time gathering, data about someone was very difficult due to fewer Internet resources.But, this digital era has overcome the techniques used for information gathering in 90's by Intelligence Gathering. It includes gathering data from various public sources and their API. Activities which one performs in its entire lifespan is recorded by various public sources.Intelligence Gathering includes human, geo-location, open-source, signals, digital and financial intelligence. The CIA, NSA, and RGA are using OSINT for collecting data as collateral information.\n\nIn order to debunk people myth's about information gathering, I made an open source tool called as OSINT-SPY which I will release after this talk. OSINT-SPY can find information about a person, email, an organization, person's geolocation, domain names, publically available devices on the internet and so on. It can be used by Data Miners, Infosec Researchers, Penetration Testers and cyber crime investigator in order to find deep information about their target.\n\nIn this talk, my main focus will be to demonstrate different techniques to gather information from public API, resources and understanding the need of implementing OSINT in any organization because open sources may often be useful in penetrating across closed borders than open societies.",

The analysis shows how these weaknesses can be used by an attacker applying a man in the middle technique to write arbitrary data to the victim's Windows registry, and consequently execute code remotely. The article also describes a tool capable of intercepting the Windows Registry protocol packets and modifying them.\n\nThe insertion of these values is not trivial, since the modification of the length of a field in a certain packet layer causes inconsistency in the control fields of the lower layers (such as lengths or checksums). Additionally, the following sequence number of a packet in a session is based on the length of the packet, causing the connection to break. The tool automatically recalculates all control fields for the TCP / IP / SMB2 / RPC layers of the different protocol packets, and applies an algorithm for correcting the sequence numbers of all packets so that, once a value has been entered by an attacker, the connection will not break. This tool is the only public application capable of performing a man in the middle attack on the Remote Windows Registry protocol.",

      "description" : "Back in 2016, it was very new the way how the Facebook mobile application implements content through Instant articles. A user can view content from third parties directly in the Facebook platform without requiring to open the Browser, for instance. This content can also be shared, saved, opened in browser and so on.\nIn this talk, we will share how this Instant articles, and the way the were shared, lead us to the possibility to access Facebook accounts and how through internet searches this became a huge problem! We'll discuss how we identify the issue and how it was tested, reported, fixed, rewarded and also we talk about a new vector attack for further research",

      "description" : "It is widely accepted that security mistakes are quicker and cheaper to fix the sooner they are identified after being introduced. With that as a guiding principle, DevSkim was developed to help identify certain insecure patterns as the developer is writing code within their IDE. Currently integrating with Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and Sublime, DevSkim is an open sourced extension that flags insecure patterns inline in the IDE, provides security guidance to explain the issue, and offers automatic fixes. DevSkim supports multiple programming and scripting languages, and its rules syntax makes adding a new rule for any language straightforward. The most effective security processes use layers of validation to identify and address security mistakes - DevSkim aims to be the first layer in that approach, complementing rather than replacing more time intensive build time Static Analysis, or post-build Dynamic Analysis.",

      "description" : "Java Serialization is an important and useful feature of Core Java that allows developers to transform a graph of Java objects into a stream of bytes for storage or transmission and then back into a graph of Java objects. Unfortunately, the Java Serialization architecture is highly insecure and has led to numerous vulnerabilities, including remote code execution (RCE) and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Any Java program that deserializes a stream is susceptible to such vulnerabilities unless proper mitigations are taken. One such mitigation strategy is look-ahead deserialization or look-ahead object input streams (LAOIS). This presentation examines Java deserialization vulnerabilities and evaluates various LAOIS solutions including JDK Enhancement Proposal (JEP) 290.",

Its impact can be devastating and variants of it will be around for a long time. You need to identify it, stop it, and prevent its spread. I had the opportunity to become familiar with the structure, design, and weaknesses of Mirai and its variants. At this talk you'll learn how to detect members of the botnet, mess with them through various means and setup a safe live fire lab environment for your own amusement. I will demonstrate how to join a C2 server, how to collect new samples for study, and some changes that have occurred since release of the source code. By the end you'll be armed and ready to take the fight to these jerks. Unless you're a botnet operator. Then you'll learn about some of the mistakes you made.",

Don't worry, you can respawn at the back of the line. The Box is an extremely realistic EOD challenge that will test your skills against a variety of traps, alarms, and tamper-evident sensors.\n\n\tOfficial Rules:\n\n\t* Do not cut any wires or remove any tape. The Box will instantly kill you in 99.9% of these situations and you'll force the TEV staff to waste time making repairs.\n\n\t* If Rule #1 isn't explicit enough, do not cause any permanent damage or modification to The Box.\n\n\t* Two players form a team; signups start on Friday in the TEV. Only team members can be near The Box during your run.\n\n\t* You are not provided any tools. What sort of EOD tech doesn't bring tools? The Box can be beat with less than $5 of easily acquired equipment.\n\n\t* If you blow up, stop what you're doing and step back from the box. You're dead. Please don't make us install the dye packs and flashbangs (seriously).\n\nPlease let datagram know if you have any questions. Good luck to all those who compete!",
