What does it all mean, should we be afraid, excited, hopeful? Hardware-based security features are not the end of the world, nor its savior, but they can be fun and useful. Although these technologies are vulnerability research targets, their trust concepts can be used to build secure software and devices.\n\nThis primer covers practical defensive uses of existing and upcoming hardware security and mobile trust technologies. We will overview the strengths, pitfalls, gotchas of these esoteric acronyms; and explain the capabilities of related features built into consumer and enterprise laptops, mobile, and embedded devices.

The phone system evolved, somewhat, in an attempt to shut them out, and phreaking became both difficult and legally dangerous. Such events paralleled a new personal computer \u201crevolution\u201d wherein phone phreaks made the transition from the secret subtleties of telephony to the new and mystical frontier of personal computing. Private BBS(s) and, eventually, the Internet was not only the next logical step forward, but also provided \u201csafer\u201d alternatives that still allowed for the thrill of exploring the mysteries of a new modern age. Telephony, and voice security in general, became, as the years passed, something of a lost art to all but those who remember...\n \nIn this presentation we begin our adventure with a journey back in time, starting in the post-war Film Noir era of the 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s, when users required an operator at the switchboard to make a call, investigating some of the early roots of phreaking that many have forgotten. We will briefly take a look at the weaknesses of early telephone systems and the emergence of the original phreaks in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s who found and exploited them. Our journey will also allow us to demonstrate how some of the same basic phreaking approaches are still applicable to today\u2019s \"advanced\" VoIP systems.\n \nCertainly the initial creation and emergence of VoIP opened a variety of attack vectors that were covered at security conferences at the time. Commercial VoIP adoption, however, remained stagnant until standards and carriers caught up. Some VoIP hacking tools were left unmaintained, and VoIP wasn\u2019t the sexy and mysterious attack vector it once was with the exception of tricksters who found old or insecure systems to be easy targets. Due to increased VoIP adoption over the last few years, however, telephony attacks are provocative once again.\n \nAs hardboiled VoIP detectives, we\u2019ll unravel the mysteries of the curious, shadowy, and secretive world of phreaks, tricksters, and VoIP hackers. We\u2019ll compare and contrast old school phreaking with new advances in VoIP hacking. We\u2019ll explain how voice systems are targeted, how they are attacked using old and new methods, and how to secure them - with demonstrations along with practical and actionable tips along the way.

Despite this fact, very few of us, security researchers consider them as interesting targets. Granted, you won't likely be able to directly hack into a big corporate network via game exploits, but you could for example target the people running the company via their favorite games. Or their children's favorite games. Another scenario: you should consider that a hacked game could allow Not So Admirable people access to your internal network - which at first does not seem that big of a deal considering it's \"just\" a home network, but when you realize all your mobile phones, your TV set, your VOIP phones, your security cameras, and even your smart house sensors and controllers are part of that network, it looks much more scary.\n  \n  Games are also interesting from a technical standpoint too, since they tend to be quite complex. The majority of them have networking, and they process complex data structures (maps, saved games, etc.) which makes them ideal fuzzing targets. But this talk is not about those kind of exploits. Hackers tend to ignore the low hanging fruits in favor of beautiful exploits, but we really shouldn't - bad guys don't care about how sophisticated some exploit is, they only care about the results. This is why I have decided to take a look around and see what's already there in the games that allows access to the gamers' network. Thus this research about how game scripting engines can be abused started.\n  \n  I'll show in this talk that playing on custom game servers and playing community created maps could easily lead to code execution on our machines - more so, in most cases without the need to bypass the operating system's exploit mitigation techniques. My targets include popular games and game engines like CryEngine 3, Dota 2, Garry's Mod, ARMA3 and Digital Combat Simulator. I'll show a wide range of script abuse from a simple direct command execution in an unrestricted scripting environment through brute forcing a security camera via HTTP requests to complex script sandbox escapes.\n  \n  Tamas is the lead IT security researcher at PR-Audit Ltd., a company focusing mainly on penetration testing and SIEM software developing.

Drake Sr. Director of Platform Research and Exploitation, Zimperium\n  \n  With over a billion activated devices, Android holds strong as the market leading smartphone operating system. Underneath the hood, it is primarily built on the tens of gigabytes of source code from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). Thoroughly reviewing a code base of this size is arduous at best -- arguably impossible. Several approaches exist to combat this problem. One such approach is identifying and focusing on a particularly dangerous area of code.\n  \n  This presentation centers around the speaker's experience researching a particularly scary area of Android, the Stagefright multimedia framework. By limiting his focus to a relatively small area of code that's critically exposed on 95% of devices, Joshua discovered a multitude of implementation issues with impacts ranging from unassisted remote code execution down to simple denial of service. Apart from a full explanation of these vulnerabilities, this presentation also discusses; techniques used for discovery, Android OS internals, and the disclosure process. Finally, proof-of-concept code will be demonstrated.\n  \n  After attending this presentation, you will understand how to discover vulnerabilities in Android more effectively. Joshua will show you why this particular code is so scary, what has been done to help improve the overall security of the Android operating system, and what challenges lie ahead.\n  \n  Joshua J.

Updates to the Wassenaar Arrangement in 2013 established among its 41 member nations an agreement to place a variety of previously undesignated \u201ccybersecurity items\u201d under export control. After 18 months and a half-dozen open advisory meetings, the U.S. has taken the entire security research community by surprise with its proposed rule; we are confronted by a sweeping implementation with profound consequences for academia, independent research, commercial cybersecurity, human rights, and national security.\n\nWhile the outcome of this round of regulatory intervention is still uncertain, the fact that there will be more is not. This panel of experts will discuss the context, history, and general process of regulation, as well the related question of \u201cweaponized\u201d research in regulatory discourse.  \n\nThere is significant daylight between the relatively lax text of the Wassenaar Arrangement itself and the extraordinarily broad implementation proposed in the U.S. What will the practical effects of those differences be, and why did the U.S. diverge from the Wassenaar text? Regulators are, even now, still struggling to comprehend what the consequences of this new \u201ccyber rule\u201d might be. So, how are we to understand this regulatory process? What are its objectives? Its impacts? Its limits? How can we influence its outcomes?\n\nEleventh-hour interventions are quickly becoming a hallmark of regulatory activities with implications for the wider world of information security; the fight here is almost exclusively a rearguard action. Without resorting to the usual polemics, what failures of analysis and advice are contributing to these missteps \u2013 on both sides? What interests might encourage them? How are security researchers being caught so off-balance?

It takes passion, dedication, and an unwavering attention to detail.  Hacking requires a breadth of knowledge spread across many domains.  We need to have experience with different platforms, operating systems, software packages, tools, programming languages, and technology trends.  Being overly deficient in any one of these areas can add hours to our hack, or even worse, bring us total failure.\n\nAnd while all of these things are important for a well-rounded hacker, one of the key areas that is often overlooked is cryptography.  In an era dominated by security breaches, an understanding of encryption and hashing algorithms provides a tremendous advantage.  We can better hone our attack vectors, especially when looking for security holes.  A few years ago I released the first Blu-Ray device key, AA856A1BA814AB99FFDEBA6AEFBE1C04, by exploiting a vulnerability in an implementation of the AACS protocol.  As hacks go, it was a simple one.  But it was the knowledge of crypto that made it all possible.\n\nThis presentation is an overview of the most common crypto routines helpful to hackers.  We'll review the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm, which ones to embrace, and which ones to avoid.  You'll get C++ code examples, high-level wrapper classes, and an open-source library that implements all the algorithms.  We'll even talk about creative ways to merge algorithms to further increase entropy and key strength.  If you've ever wanted to learn how crypto can give you an advantage as a hacker, then this talk is for you.  With this information you'll be able to maximize your hacks and better protect your personal data.\n\nEijah is the founder of demonsaw, a secure and anonymous content sharing platform, and a Senior Programmer at a world-renowned game development studio.

There have been talks that have identified the risks that are caused by the inherent trust between the OS and any device attached by USB. I found in my research that most of the available payloads for the USB rubber ducky would be stopped by common enterprise security solutions. I then set out to create a new exploit that would force the victim to trust my Man-In-The-Middle access point.

However, if a cyber attack can be performed through proxy servers jumping several countries before reaching the U.S., then can anyone ever be sure of who is really behind the attack? Yet we often see newspaper headlines clearly identifying that one country is hacking another country through state-sponsored, cyber criminal, or hacktivist means.  Even if government cyber analysts with TS/SCI security clearances have high confidence in the identity of an attacker based on forensics and human intelligence, what are the challenges in effectively addressing the topic in a diplomatic or military dialogue with the attacker country?\n \nTwo major roadblocks in cyber diplomacy are the \"attribution problem,\" and the related \"disclosure dilemma.\"  If there is indeed an attribution problem--when a country cannot be sure which other state is hacking it because a third country could be using it as a proxy--then a country could never accuse another countries of state-sponsored cyber attacks.  Yet, countries routinely accuse others of cyber attacks, the public sees this in newspapers almost every day, and it is often an important topic in bilateral dialogues. Furthermore, the disclosure dilemma occurs when a country has both incentives and disincentives to disclose details on how it was hacked.  On one hand, evidence will prove its case, but on another hand, evidence will make the attacker more savvy and careful not to repeat the same mistakes next time.  Disclosure could create a stronger adversary.  These are major concerns in the practice of cyber diplomacy today. \n \nMy presentation identifies how government-to-government cyber diplomacy works, examines the attribution problem and disclosure dilemma more fully, and shows how the U.S. approaches this topic  differently with partners versus potential adversaries.

The technical details will be presented during the presentation, as well as the results and propositions.\n\nBasically, the idea is to use a kernel mode driver which encrypts each keyboard key hit, at a very low level in the system (near the driver port). The encryption is made according to a common key, exchanged with a client application which needs to ensure that the entered text is secured and not recorded. After the driver has encrypted a key, it spreads it to the entire system. Thus, only the client application, holding the encryption key, can decrypt the keyboard key.

A vast majority of DGA algorithms create random sequences of characters. In this work we present a novel language-based technique for detecting strings that are generate by chaining random characters. To evaluate randomness of a given string (domain name in this context) we lookup substrings of the string in the dictionary that we\u2019ve built for this technique, and then we calculate a randomness score for the string based on several different factors including length of the string, number of languages that cover the substrings, etc. This score is used for determining whether the given string is a random sequence of characters. In order to evaluate the performance of this technique, on the one hand we use 9 known DGA algorithms to create random domain names as DGA domains, and on the other hand we use domain names from the Alexa 10,000 as likely non-DGA domains. The results show that our technique is more than 99% accurate in detecting random and non-random domain names.\n  \n  Mahdi Namazifar is currently a Senior Data Scientist with Talos team of Cisco Systems' San Francisco Innovation Center (SFIC).

To try and avoid detection, you often want to try and obfuscate or hide your browsers, particularly if you're heavily targeting a single organization. Don\u2019t worry Internet-friends, those crazy pioneers at Google, Mozilla and Opera have solved this problem for you with the introduction of Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC). Initially designed to allow browsers to stream multimedia to each other, the spec has made its way into most Chrome and Firefox browsers, not to mention it\u2019s enabled by default.\n\nUsing this bleeding-edge web technology, we can now mesh all those hooked browsers, funnelling all your BeEF comms through a single sacrificial beach-head. Leveraging WebRTC technologies (such as STUN/TURN and even the fact the RTC-enabled browsers on local subnets can simply UDP each other), meshing browsers together can really throw a spanner into an incident-responders work. The possibilities for a browser-attacker are fairly endless, channeling comms through a single browser, or, making all the browsers communicate with each other in round-robin.

Let\u2019s face it, after such elite hacking action nobody is going to let one present it even at a conference like DEF CON. As a poor substitute, this presentation will get as close as using a simulated plant for Vinyl Acetate production for demonstrating a complete attack, from start to end, directed at persistent economic damage to a production site while avoiding attribution of production loss to a cyber-event. Such an attack scenario could be useful to a manufacturer aiming at putting competitors out of business or as a strong argument in an extortion attack.\n  \n  Picking up a paper these days it\u2019s easy to find an article on all the \u201cSCADA insecurity\u201d out there associated with an unstoppable attacker with unsophisticated goal of kicking up another apocalypse. Sorry to disappoint excited crowd but formula \u201cYour wish is my command\u201d does not work for control systems.  The target plant is not designed in a hacker friendly way. Hopefully by the end of the presentation, the audience will understand the difference between breaking into the system and breaking the system, obtaining control and being in control.  An attacker targeting a remote process is not immediately gifted with complete knowledge of the process and the means to manipulate it. In general, an attacker follows a series of stages before getting to the final attack. Designing an attack scenario is a matter of art as much as economic consideration. The cost of attack can quickly exceed damage worth. Also, the attacker has to find the way to compare between competing attack scenarios.\n  \n  In traditional IT hacking, a goal is to go undetected. In OT (operational technologies) hacking this is not an option. An attack will change things in the real world that cannot be removed by simply erasing the log files. If a piece of equipment is damaged or if a plant suddenly becomes less profitable, it will be investigated. The attacker has to create forensic footprint for investigators by manipulating the process and the logs in such a way that the analysts draw the wrong conclusions.\n  \n  Exploiting physical process is an exotic and hard to develop skill which have so far kept a high barrier to entry.

Is it now illegal to share exploit code across borders, or to disclose a vulnerability to a software vendor in another country? Can export controls really keep surveillance technology developed in the west out of the hands of repressive regimes? This presentation will provide a deep dive on the text of the new controls and discuss what they are meant to cover, how the US Government has indicated that it may interpret them, and what those interpretations potentially mean for computer security researchers, and for the Internet as a whole.\n\nTom Cross is the CTO of Drawbridge Networks.

HMIs are control panels that provide interfaces for humans to interact with machines and to manage operations of various types of SCADA systems. HMIs have direct access to SCADA databases including critical software programs. The majority of SCADA systems have web-based HMIs that allow the humans to control the SCADA operations remotely through Internet. This talk unveils various flavors of undisclosed vulnerabilities in web-based SCADA HMIs including but not limited to remote or local file inclusions, insecure authentication through clients, weak password hashing mechanisms, firmware discrepancies, hardcoded credentials, insecure web-services, weak cryptographic design, cross-site request forgery, and many others. This talk digs deeper into the design models of various SCADA systems to highlight security deficiencies in the existing SCADA HMI deployments. The research is driven with a motivation to secure SCADA devices and to build more intelligent solutions by hunting vulnerabilities in SCADA HMIs. The vulnerabilities presented in this talk are completely undisclosed and will be revealed for the first time with live demonstrations. \n\nAditya K Sood (Ph.D) is a senior security researcher and consultant.

Fortunately for us, despite the rise of memory-safe, interpreted, lame languages, the security of binaries is as relevant as ever. On top of that, (computer security) Capture the Flag competitions have skyrocketed in popularity, with new and exciting binaries on offer for hacking every weekend.\n\nThis all sounds great, and it is. Unfortunately, the more time goes by, the older we get, and the more our skills fade. Whereas we were happy to stare at objdump a decade ago, today, we find the menial parts of reversing and pwning more and more tiring and more and more difficult. Worse, while security analysis tools have been evolving to make life easier for us hackers, the core tools that we use (like IDA Pro) have remained mostly stagnant. And on top of that, the term \"binaries\" have expanded to regularly include ARM, MIPS, PPC, MSP430, and every other crazy architecture you can think of, rather than the nice, comfortable x86 of yesteryear.\n\nNew tools are required, and we're here to deliver. Over the last two years, we have been working on a next-generation binary analysis framework in an attempt to turn back the tide and reduce our mounting noobness. The result is called angr.\n\nangr assists in binary analysis by providing extremely powerful, state-of-the-art analyses, and making them as straightforward to use as possible. Ever wanted to know *what freaking value* some variable could take on in a function (say, can the target of a computed write point to the return address)? angr can tell you! Want to know what input you need to trigger a certain code path and export a flag? Ask angr! In the talk, we'll cover three of the analyses that angr provides: a powerful static analysis engine (able to, among other things, automatically identify potential memory corruption in binaries through the use of Value-Set Analysis), its symbolic execution engine, and dynamic emulation of various architectures (*super* useful for debugging shellcode).\n\nOn top of that, angr is designed to make the life of a hacker as easy as possible -- for example, the whole system is 98% Python, and is designed to be a breeze to interact with through iPython. Plus, it comes with a nifty GUI with nice visualizations for symbolically exploring a program, tracking differences between different program paths, and understanding value ranges of variables and registers. Finally, angr is designed to be easily extensible and embeddable in other applications. We'll show off a semantic-aware ROP gadget finder (\"are there any gadgets that write to a positive offset of rax but don't clobber rbx\" or \"given this program state, what are the gadgets that won't cause a segfault\") and a binary diffing engine, both built on angr.\n\nWe've used angr to solve CTF binaries, analyze embedded devices, debug shellcode, and even dabble in the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge. We'll talk about our experiences with all of that and will release angr to the world, hopefully revolutionizing binary analysis and making everyone ANGRY!\n\n\nYan and Fish are two members of Shellphish, a pretty badass hacking team famous for low SLA and getting the freaking exploit JUST A FREAKING MINUTE LATE. Their secret identities are those of PhD students in the security lab of UC Santa Barbara. When they're not CTFing or surfing, they're doing next-generation (what does that even mean?) security research. Their works have been published in numerous academic venues. For example, in 2013, they created an automatic tool, called MovieStealer, a tool to automatically break the DRM of streaming media services [1]. After taking 2014 to work on angr, in 2015, they followed this up with an analysis of backdoors in embedded devices [2].\n\n\nNow, they've set their sights on helping the world analyze binaries faster, better, stronger, by revolutionizing the analysis tool landscape!\n\n\n[1] https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity13/technical-sessions/paper/wang_ruoyu\n[2] http://www.internetsociety.org/doc/firmalice-automatic-detection-authentication-bypass-vulnerabilities-binary-firmware\n\nTwitter: @zardus", "title": "Angry Hacking - the next generation of binary analysis", "demo": "1", "tool": "1", "who": "Yan Shoshitaishvili & Fish Wang", "exploit": "0", "link": "https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-23/dc-23-speakers.html#Shoshitaishvili", "location": "Track 2", "date": "2015-08-08", "type": "Official", "id": "4278"}, {"begin": "13:00", "end": "14:50", "description": "\nWhyMI so Sexy?

FireEye has recently seen a surge in attacker use of WMI to carry out objectives such as system reconnaissance, remote code execution, persistence, lateral movement, covert data storage, and VM detection. Defenders and forensic analysts have largely remained unaware of the value of WMI due to its relative obscurity and completely undocumented file format. After extensive reverse engineering, our team has documented the WMI repository file format in detail, developed libraries to parse it, and formed a methodology for finding evil in the repository.\n\nIn this talk, we will take a deep dive into the architecture of WMI, reveal a case study in attacker use of WMI in the wild, describe WMI attack mitigation strategies, show how to mine its repository for forensic artifacts, and demonstrate how to detect attacker activity in real-time by tapping into the WMI eventing system. By the end of this talk, we will have convinced the audience that WMI is a valuable asset not just for system administrators and attackers, but equally so for defenders and forensic analysts.\n\nMatt Graeber is a reverse engineer in the FireEye Labs Advanced Reverse Engineering (FLARE) team with a varied background in reverse engineering, red teaming, and offensive tool development.

Those attack vectors are not unique to Cloud Computing but there are magnified due to the cloud characteristics. The fact is that IaaS instance lifecycle is accelerating, nowadays we can find servers that are installed, launched, process data and terminate - all within a range of minutes. This new accelerated lifecycle makes traditional security processes such as periodic patches, vulnerability scanning, hardening, and forensics impossible. In this accelerated lifecycle, there are no maintenance windows for patches or ability to mitigate vulnerability, so the security infrastructure must adapt to new methods. In this new thinking, we require automation of instance security configuration, hardening, monitoring, and termination. Because there are no maintenance windows, Servers must be patched before they boot up, security configuration and hardening procedures should be integrated with server installation and vulnerability scanning and mitigation processes should be automatic.\n\nIn the presentation, we plan to announce the full version of a new open source tool called \"Cloudefigo\" and explain how it enables accelerated security lifecycle. We demonstrate how to launch a pre-configured, already patched instance into an encrypted storage environment automatically while evaluating their security and mitigating them automatically if a vulnerability is found. In the live demo, we leverage Amazon Web Services EC2 Cloud-Init scripts and object storage for provisioning automated security configuration, integrating encryption, including secure encryption key repositories for secure server's communication. The result of those techniques is cloud servers that are resilient, automatically configured, with the reduced attack surface.\n\nNir is employed at NCR Corporation as the CISO of NCR Retail.

In recent years, fuzzing has become a near mandatory part of any major application's security team efforts. Our work focused on fuzzing web browsers, a particularly difficult challenge given the size and quality of some of their security teams, the existing high-quality fuzzers available for this, and, of late, bug bounty programs.\n\nDespite this, our improved fuzzing approach was able to find four confirmed bugs within Google Chrome and two within Microsoft Internet Explorer 11. The bugs had varying potential exploitability. Interestingly, some had been independently discovered indicating others are active in this field. The work is on going, and we hope to have more before the presentation.\n\nAs browsers continue to grow as the new universal interface for devices and applications, they have become high value targets for exploitation. Additionally, with the growth of browser fuzzing since 2004, this is a complex field to get started in. Something we hope to help address.\n\nOur research and presentation will consist of two parts: \n\nThe first part is an introduction to fuzzing for the security practitioner. Here we combine the approaches, tool sets and integrations between tools we found to be most effective into a recipe for fuzzing various browsers and various platforms. \n\nThe second part is a description of our work and approach used to create, and extend, browser fuzzing grammars based on w3c specifications to discover new and unexplored code paths, and find new browser security bugs.

Bull Ph.D. Graduate Student, Clarkson University\nJeanna N. Matthews Associate Professor, Clarkson University\n\nCloud service providers offer their customers the ability to deploy virtual machines in a multi-tenant environment. These virtual machines are typically connected to the physical network via a virtualized network configuration. This could be as simple as a bridged interface to each virtual machine or as complicated as a virtual switch providing more robust networking features such as VLANs, QoS, and monitoring. In this paper, we explore whether Layer 2 network attacks that work on physical switches apply to their virtualized counterparts by performing a systematic study across four major hypervisor environments - Open vSwitch, Citrix XenServer, Microsoft Hyper-V Server and VMware vSphere - in seven different virtual networking configurations. First, we use a malicious virtual machine to run a MAC flooding attack and evaluate the impact on co-resident VMs. We find that network performance is degraded on all platforms and that it is possible to eavesdrop on other client traffic passing over the same virtual network for Open vSwitch and Citrix XenServer. Second, we use a malicious virtual machine to run a rogue DHCP server and then run multiple DHCP attack scenarios. On all four platforms, co-resident VMs can be manipulated by providing them with incorrect or malicious network information.\n\nMr. Bull is a Computer Science Ph.D. graduate student at Clarkson University focusing on Layer 2 network security in virtualized environments. He presented his preliminary research involving MAC flooding attacks against virtualized networks at the DerbyCon 4.0 computer security conference held in Louisville, KY in September 2014.

Mr. Bull recently made a transition to Utica College as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science with a focus in networking and cybersecurity.

You thought \"I haven't seen a mainframe since the 90s, no one uses those anymore.\" Well you're wrong. Dead wrong. If you flew or drove to DEF CON your information was hitting a mainframe. Did you use credit or cash at the hotel? Doesn't matter, still a mainframe. Did you pay taxes, or perhaps call 911? What about going to the doctor? All using mainframes. At multiple points throughout the day, even if you don't do anything, your data is going through some mainframe, somewhere. 1984? Yeah right, man. That's a typo. Orwell is here now. He's livin' large. So why is no one talking about them?\n\n\nSoF & Bigendian Smalls, aka 'the insane chown posse', will dazzle and amaze with feats of hackery never before seen on the mainframe. From fully breaking network job entry (NJE) and their concept of trusted nodes, to showing you what happens when you design security in the 80s and never update your frameworks. We'll demonstrate that, yes Charlie Brown, you can in fact overflow a buffer on the mainframe. New tools will be released! Things like SET'n'3270 (SET, but for mainframes!) and VTAM walker (profiling VTAM applications). Updates to current tools will be released (nmap script galore!) everything from accurate version profiling to application ID brute forcing and beyond. You'll also learn how to navigate IBM so you can get access to your very own mainframe and help continue the research that we've started!\n\n\nAll of your paychecks rely on mainframes in one form or another, so maybe we should be talking about it.\n\nSoldier of Fortran:\nProtect ya REXX! Soldier of Fortran has an unhealthy relationship with mainframes. Being a hacker from way back in the day (BBS and X.25 networks) he was always enamored by the idea of hacking mainframes. Always too expensive and mysterious he settled on hacking windows and linux machines. However, despite not having his own he conducted numerous security engagements against mainframes, slowly developing his skills, until 2010 when he finally got his very own. Not having to worry about system uptime or affecting users he dove in head first and was surprised by what he found. Ever since he has been telling anyone who will listen to him the importance of mainframe security, hacking and research. He\u2019s spoken both domestically and internationallyon the topic, been a guest speaker at multiple conferences, developed tools for mainframe penetration testing and has even keynoted at large mainframe conferences about this topic.\n\n\nBigendian Smalls:\nBS ain't no chump, takin' apart everything as a child just to see how it works invariable led him to security. From BBSin' back in the day to placing second in the network forensics challenge last year he knows what he's doing. At work and at home he does vulnerability research, forensics and disassembly of all things both on hardware and software. Knowing no system is secure and seeing how closed the source, community and information around the mainframe is he got worried. Worried that the code was as secure as they said it was. Worried that because no one is looking, developers are getting away with murder. Sure, IBM says they got their shit together, but then again so does Oracle, CISCO, Fireeye etc . Having worked on mainframes for more than a decade he knows how frustrating this is.

This gave me the opportunity to investigate the unique security challenges and issues facing the industry. It was a shock to me at first how complex the advertising ecosystem was particularly in the advent of programmatic advertising. But I dove in head first and learned a lot which I would like to share with my fellow security professionals. During this time, I got involved with unscrupulous publishers, apathetic ad networks, angry advertisers and activist malware researchers. I encountered self proclaimed experts with fantastic claims, vendors using scare tactics, and a glaring disconnect between the security and ad tech worlds.   \n\nIn this presentation, I would like to be able to provide the audience with my experience plus a number of things. Among which are:\n\n\nProvide security professionals a 101 type of introduction to the world of digital advertising ecosystem. Among the things we will tackle is what is programmatic advertising, what the roles are of the different players like ad networks are and how money is made off all this interplay. \n\nProvide the audience a perspective on what security challenges the advertising industry is facing and opportunities for us security professionals to be involved. We all know about malvertising and its a big deal to us security guys but there are bigger, and in an advertisers perspective, more relevant issues that needs to be taken care of first. All of this will be discussed in this talk.   \n\nAn introduction about the different and creative ways unscrupulous publishers can pad their earnings. We will be talking about hidden ads, ad stacking, intrusive ads, auto-refreshes, popups, popunders, blackhat SEO techniques and dirty inventory. \n\nAn in depth discussion on the problems caused by non-human traffic (NHT). We will talk about what it is, why is it a problem, how it is generated, and more importantly, how do we catch it?  In fact, this presentation is named the \u201cBieber Project\u201d which is the experiment which I leveraged to understand non-human traffic and determine how we can identify it. \n\n\n\nMark Ryan Talabis is the Chief Security Scientist for zVelo Inc where he conducts research on advertising fraud and non-human traffic.

By placing a common, Linux-based, install environment onto the firmware of the switch, customers can deploy the Network Operating Systems of their choice onto the switch and do so whenever they like without replacing the hardware. The problem is, if this gets compromised, it also makes it possible for hackers to install malware onto the switch. Malware that can manipulate it and your network, and keep doing it long after a Network Operating System reinstall.\n  \n  With no secure boot, no encryption, no authentication, predictable HTTP/TFTP waterfalls, and exposed post-installation partition, ONIE is very susceptible to compromise. And with Network Operating Systems such as Switch Light, Cumulus Linux, and Mellanox-OS via their agents Indigo and eSwitchd not exactly putting up a fight with problems like no authentication, no encryption, poor encryption, and insufficient isolation, this is a real possibility.\n  \n  In this session, we'll cover the weaknesses in ONIE, ways to reach the platform through these Network Operating Systems, and what can happen if we don't properly protect the Control Plane these switches run on. I'll even demonstrate with a drive-by web-attack that is able to pivot through a Windows management station to reach the isolated control plane network, and infect one of these ONIE-based switches with malware, malware that's there even after a refresh. You'll even get the source code to take home with you to see how easily it's done. Finally, we'll talk about how to compensate for these issues so that your network doesn't become infected with and manipulated by this sort of persistent firmware-level malware.\n  \n  Gregory Pickett CISSP, GCIA, GPEN has a background in intrusion analysis for Fortune 100 companies but now heads up Hellfire Security\u2019s Managed Security Services efforts and participates in their assessment practice as a network security subject matter expert.

Regardless of whether it is using quantum effects for computation or not, the D-Wave architecture cannot run the standard quantum algorithms, such as Grover\u2019s and Shor\u2019s.

Network interfaces are the racing stripes of today's consumer device market. And if you put a network interface on a device, you have to make it do something right? That's where a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) service comes in. SOAP services are designed with ease-of-access in mind, many times at the expense of security. Ludicrous amounts of control over device functionality, just about every category of vulnerability you can think of, and an all-around lack of good security practice about sums it up.

The current state of forensics tools in Linux, lack the sophistication used by the infection methods found in real world hacks. ECFS (Extended core file snapshot) technology, https://github.com/elfmaster/ecfs is an innovative extension to regular ELF core files, designed to be used as forensics-friendly snapshots of process memory. A brief showcasing of the ECFS technology was featured in POC||GTFO 0x7 (Innovations with core files).\n\nHowever this talk will reveal deeper insight on the many features of this technology, such as full symbol table reconstruction, builtin detection heuristics, and how common binutils such as objdump, and readelf can be used to quickly identify complex infections such as PLT/GOT hooks and shared library injection. We will also cover the libecfs API that was created specifically for malware and forensics analysts who aim to implement support for ECFS snapshots into new or existing malware detection software. \n\nWhile the ECFS core format was initially designed for runtime malware and forensics purposes, another very neat aspect to this technology was quickly extrapolated on; the ECFS snapshots can also be reloaded into memory and executed. Very similar to VM snapshots, which opens many more doors for research and exploration in a vast array of areas from dynamic analysis to migrating live processes across systems. ECFS is still a work in progress, but for those who understand the arduous nature of dissecting a process and identifying anomalies, will surely acquire a quick respect for the new technology that makes all of this so much easier.\n\n\nRyan 'elfmaster' O'Neill is a computer security researcher at Leviathan Security and the maintainer of Bitlackeys.org, a hub for much of his independent research.

In recent years Linux containers have developed from an insecure and loose collection of Linux kernel namespaces to a production-ready OS virtualization stack. In this talk, the audience will first learn the basics of how containers function, understanding namespaces, capabilities and cgroups in order to see how Linux containers and the supporting kernel features can offer an effective application and system sandboxing solution yet to be widely deployed or adopted. Understanding LXC or Docker use, weaknesses and security for PaaS and application sandboxing is only the beginning.\n\nLeveraging container technologies is rapidly becoming popular within the modern PaaS and devops world but little has been publicly discussed in terms of actual security risks or guarantees. Understanding prior container vulnerabilities or escapes, and current risks or pitfalls in major public platforms will be explored in this talk. I'll cover methods to harden containers against future attacks and common mistakes to avoid when using systems such as LXC and Docker. This will also include an analysis and discussion of techniques such as Linux kernel hardening, reduced capabilities, Mandatory Access Controls (MAC), the User kernel namespace and seccomp-bpf (syscall filtering); all of which help actually contain containers. The talk will end on some methods for creating minimal, highly-secure containers and end on where containers are going and why they might show up where you least expect them.\n\nAaron Grattafiori (@dyn___) is a Principal Security Consultant and Research Lead with iSEC Partners/NCC Group.

Lee\n  \n  This talk will introduce you to Industrial Ethernet Switches and their vulnerabilities. These are switches used in industrial environments, like substations, factories, refineries, ports, or other  homes of industrial automation. In other words: DCS, PCS, ICS & SCADA switches.\n  \n  The researchers focus on attacking the management plane of these switches, because we all know that industrial system protocols lack authentication or cryptographic integrity. Thus, compromising any switch allows the creation of malicious firmwares for further MITM manipulation of a live process.  Such MITM manipulation can lead to the plant or process shutting down (think: nuclear reactor SCRAM) or getting into a unknown and hazardous state (think: damaging a blast furnace at a steel mill)\n  \n  Not only will vulnerabilities be disclosed for the first time, but the methods of finding those vulnerabilities will be shared. All vulnerabilities disclosed will be in the default configuration state of the devices. While these vulnerabilities have been responsibly disclosed to the vendors, SCADA/ICS patching in live environments tends to take 1-3 years.  Because of this patching lag, the researchers will also be providing live mitigations that owner/operators can use immediately to protect themselves. At least four vendors switches will be examined: Siemens, GE, Garrettcom and Opengear.\n  \n  Colin Cassidy is a security consultant for IOActive where he focuses on Industrial Control Systems.
