Check out this tutorial to get started.\n\nEven if you are an experienced Core War player, please TEST your warriors on the MARS we are using before submitting them.

Bring that 'puter your mom bought you for Christmas and join the fun dissecting hacker challenges, digital forensic artifacts and bring your picks for the physical security obstacles. Registration will open for warl0ck gam3z @ Defcon 24 Challenge once we get a nod from Defcon. In the meantime check out the FAQs and send any remaining questions to support@gam3z-inc.com.\n\nThis is a few of our most Frequently Asked Questions from previous challenges\n\n- Do I need to be attending Defcon to participate in the warl0ck gam3z challenge?\nANS: No, we have several international players participating from many places outside the U.S. that are clearly not attending Defcon\n\n- Do I need to be present (onsite) to win a prize?\nANS: Yes, in order to win in our Daily Drawings, or 1st, 2nd, 3rd place prizes, you must be onsite or have made previous arrangements with our onsite staff.\n\n- Will I need to be connected to the Internet?\nANS: Yes, you need to be connected to get the heartbeat from the gam3 server as well as retrieve (and submit) challenge material.\n\n- What kind of skillz do I need in order to be successful?\nANS: All skill levels are welcome, don't be afraid to just join in and check it out. We have friendly staff onsite that will assist you by providing pointers to get you going in the right direction should you get stuck. Don't sit frustrated, go ask questions! They WILL NOT provide you the answer, merely a direction to go to get you better positioned for a solution.\n\n- Why is a question not available to me OR why can't I back out of this question?\nANS: Questions are released by the lead player of the game, so if the leader of the board has not selected the question yet, it will not be available to anyone else. If you are the leader of the board, you cannot back out of a question....you either answer it, or get passed by another player.\n\n- What is the Moderator?\nANS: The Moderator is one of our staff that is online during the competition to answer general questions or address problems. You can drop into a private message session with the Moderator by clicking on the Moderator, your chat window should state \"Chatting with the Moderator\" along the top. Be careful when posting information to the Moderator as on some mobile platforms the chat window will go back to the \"Chatting with Everyone\" feature.",

You get the contest known as Crash and Compile.\n\nDo you think you can code? Do you think you can code while drinking? We are looking for nine teams who think they have the smarts, the concentration, and the liver to hold up to our gauntlet of programming. Teams who can not only code, but do so with style. We set you against the clock and the other teams. And because they think watching people simply code is boring, our \"Team Distraction\" is has taken it upon themselves to be creative in hindering you from programming, much to the enjoyment of the audience. \n\nQualifications take place Friday afternoon in the contest area. Teams of one or two people. Be ready to code, as this won't be easy. The top nine teams who showed themselves ostentatious enough to take on our challenge will compete on the Contest Stage Saturday.",

You do not need to go there ahead of time.\n \nDust off your cycling shorts, get out the chammois butter, ice the water, it’s almost time for another Defcon Bike Ride in Las Vegas!\n\nThe date of this years bike ride is Friday, Aug 5, 2016 at 6am. This is Friday of Defcon. We will meet outside [TBD location] at 5:30am. There [may/will] also be a contingent meeting at the Tuscany at 5:30 am.\n\nRegistration is here - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13P8g-M7MDUO1qqarB0Nh1s5iF6si2zBIwa3PZZU5oTQ/viewform. This is just so we can get a count and arrange comms leading up to the event. It will also give us your email so we can blast out any details needed pre ride, or at 5:25am on Aug 5th :).\n\nHere’s the deal – we have partnered again with McGhies Bike Shop in Las Vegas for our ride. Yes – they will throw your clipless pedals and seat posts on if you insist. They have 3 levels of road bikes:  a ~$40 Cannondale Synapse,  and a ~$100 Lance Armstrong starter kit road bike (think Madone.)  There’s also a $125 level also.\n\nBike rental is first come first serve — there are about 18 $40 male road bikes and 5 female — after that it’s a hybrid or a $100 bike.  You can always ship out your bike for about $100 each way on most airlines.\n\nYou alone are solely responsible for your bike reservation. McGhies is aware that we are running this event and will support us, but it’s on you to make sure you are all set with a bike.\n\nThe route:\nNOTE: This ride may be at a higher altitude than you are used to. (2600-3800 ft)\nOK — last piece the route – you can see the route here - http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/40203606. This is the same route as last year (and the year before). Basically the route is slightly uphill out – and mostly downhill back. It’s looking like we’ll have a car heading up the back. (thanks @myrcurial ) There may be a bigger loop for those interested – we’ll let you know soon (basically taking the scenic loop around and catching up w/the group on your way back) – but it will likely be unofficial.\nWe are looking for sponsors so let us know if you are aware of anyone interested in throwing in some schwag or some cash to help support this ride.\n\nWhat do I do next?\nOnce you reserve your bike — all you have to do is wait for Defcon 24! Oh and keep riding!\n\nCheers!\nThe Cycle Override Team\n",

QUIC is an application-layer UDP-based protocol that multiplexes connections between endpoints at the application level, rather than the kernel level. HTTP/2 (H2) is a successor to SPDY, and multiplexes different HTTP streams within a single connection. More than 10% of the top 1 Million websites are already using some of these technologies, including much of the 10 highest traffic sites. Whether you multiplex out across connections with QUIC, or multiplex into fewer connections with HTTP/2, the world has changed. We have a strong sensation of Déjà vu with this work and our 2014 Black Hat USA MPTCP research. We find ourselves discussing a similar situation in new protocols with technology stacks evolving faster than ever before, and Network Security is largely unaware of the peril already upon it. This talk briefly introduces QUIC and HTTP/2, covers multiplexing attacks beyond MPTCP, discusses how you can use these techniques over QUIC and within HTTP/2, and discusses how to make sense of and defend against H2/QUIC traffic on your network. We will also demonstrate, and release, some tools with these techniques incorporated.\n\nCatherine (Kate) Pearce (Twitter: @secvalve) is a Senior Security Consultant for Cisco, who is based in Wellington, New Zealand. Formerly a Security Consultant for Neohapsis in the USA, she has engaged with a widespread and varied range of clients to assist them in understanding their current security state, adding resilience into their systems and processes, and managing their ongoing security risk. Day-to-day she undertakes a mix of advising clients around their security, client-focused security assessments (such as penetration tests), and security research. She has spoken at her work at many security conferences, including Black Hat USA, Source Boston, Nolacon, Kiwicon, ACSC and several others. While she has recently presented on Network Security, her true loves are application security enablement, complex systems security, and cross-discipline security analogues.\n\nCarl Vincent (Twitter: @vyrus001) is a Customer Solutions Consultant for the recently consolidated Cisco Security Solutions group, where he performs a variety of security assessment types. As an information security professional, as well as personal hobbyist, his passion is to continually research ever increasingly elaborate methods of elegantly executed hypothetical crime. He also practices personal information warfare, and most of his biographic details online are somewhat exaggerated.",

Most organizations lack a defense-in-depth strategy to address the evolving social media threat landscape. The attacks are outside their network, commonly occur through their employee's personal accounts, and circumvent existing detection technologies. In this presentation we'll explore the taxonomy of social media impersonation attacks, phishing scams, information leakage, espionage, and more. We'll then provide a method to categorize these threats and develop a methodology to adapting existing incident response processes to encompass social media threats for your organization.\n\nMichael T.

We will describe data driven techniques to derive fingerprints for specific types of individual and subgroup behaviors. The goal of these methods is to add context to communications taking place within an enterprise as well as being able to identify when certain asset profiles change there behavioral fingerprint in such a way as to indicate compromise. The type of profiles we want to discover can be tied to human behavior (User Fingerprinting) or particular asset classes like WebServers or Databases (Hardware/Software Fingerprinting). Finally enriching these profiles with a small amount of network context lets us break down the behaviors across different parts of the network topology.\n\nThese techniques become important when we want to passively monitor for certain attacks against server hardware even without visibility into the local logs running on the server. For example we will cover the automated discovery and enrichment of DMZ assets and how we use these techniques to profile when a server has been planted with a Webshell or when an asset has been used to covertly exfil data. The methods we propose should be generic to apply to a wide variety of any kind of Layer 4/ Layer 7 traffic or just PCAP data alone.\n\nRod Soto (Twitter: @rodsoto) has over 15 years of experience in information technology and security.

Security at the perimeter is inadequate for thwarting today's highly intelligent attacks as hackers routinely breach the perimeter and gain entry. It isn't long before the network is compromised and critical information is stolen. We must now assume that, despite significant investments in prevention, breaches are going to happen. An additional approach is required. Security teams must go on the offensive, creating a web of non-stop, real-time detection operations using multiple vectors against an ever-changing landscape of cyber threats. Deception technology now plays a critical role. Used as a strategy for many centuries in actual warfare, the concept of deception is becoming a significant weapon in network-protection schemes. Deception technology doesn't rely on known attack patterns and monitoring. Instead, it employs very advanced luring techniques to entice attackers away from valuable company assets and into pre-set traps, thus revealing their presence. It is able to detect threats in real time without relying on any signatures, heuristics or complex behavioral patterns. But how effective is a deception strategy in detecting breaches? What method works best? How does it integrate with current security operations already in place?\n\nIn this talk we will present findings from a first ever research which measured the efficiency of proactive deception using mini-traps and decoys in real-life threat scenarios. We have reconstructed a real enterprise environment complete with endpoints, servers, network traffic and data repositories as well as security tools such as IDS, firewall, SIEM etc. The deception layer was then integrated into the environment in 2 steps: (a) by placing decoys in the network and (b) by placing mini-traps on the assets which point to the decoys, set false credentials, trigger silent alarms and more. We then evaluated the effectiveness of the mini-traps and decoys against both automated, machine-based attacks as well as against sophisticated human attacks: The first stage involved checking the behavior of a variety of malware families against the environment and measuring the deception layer's success in detecting their activity. For the second phase, we invited red-team professionals and white hat hackers to employ real techniques and advanced tools with the task of moving laterally in the environment and exfiltrate high value data.\n\nOmer Zohar has over a decade of experience as a developer and researcher in the data security market. As head of Research for TopSpin Security he is responsible for the research of malware and post-breach detection methods and for defining advanced detection schemes.",

Fear not, we can harden our defenses. We can put safeguards in place to help avoid being the victim. For me, the answer came from an unlikely source: my daughter. Small children are fantastic. Society has not yet influenced their development; therefore, children are relentless in pursuing their aims. Since they are naive to right and wrong, they will use any tool available to get their goal. How does this help? My daughter became my trainer, and this talk discusses how interacting with her has improved my defenses. Comparing her strategies to real world examples will show how to build a training framework of your own.

With that theme in mind, the speaker researches the history of one large, government-funded infrastructure and compares it to another. Specifically, the Eisenhower Interstate System and the Internet. \"Connections: Eisenhower and the Internet\" explores what the logistical challenges of moving vehicles across the Country can teach us about cybersecurity. Although these two topics seem unrelated, the speaker will take the audience on a journey that begins with early 20th century road-building projects, travels through ARPANET and the commercialization of the Internet, and arrives at current-day cyberspace. These two massive infrastructures have changed the world, and there are important lessons that the former can teach about the latter. The presentation concludes with predictions about the future of the the Information Superhighway and how information security professionals can prepare.\n\nChef (Twitter: @damonsmall) earned his handle from his use of cooking metaphors to describe infosec concepts to laypeople. He began his career studying music at Louisiana State University and took advantage of computer skills learned in the LSU recording studio to become a systems administrator in the mid 1990s. Following the dotcom bust in the early 2000s, Chef began focusing on cyber security. This has remained his passion, and over the past 16 years as a security professional he has supported infosec initiatives in the healthcare, defense, and oil and gas industries. In addition to his Bachelor of Arts in Music, Chef completed the Master of Science in Information Assurance degree from Norwich University in 2005. His role as Technical Project Manager at NCC Group includes working closely with consultants and clients in delivering complex security assessments that meet varied business requirements.

            "description": "Machine Duping 101: Pwning Deep Learning Systems\nClarence Chio Research Data Engineer, Shape Security\n\nDeep learning and neural networks have gained incredible popularity in recent years. The technology has grown to be the most talked-about and least well-understood branch of machine learning. Aside from it's highly publicized victories in playing Go, numerous successful applications of deep learning in image and speech recognition has kickstarted movements to integrate it into critical fields like medical imaging and self-driving cars. [1] In the security field, deep learning has shown good experimental results in malware/anomaly detection, [2] APT protection, spam/phishing detection, and traffic identification. This DEF CON 101 session will guide the audience through the theory and motivations behind deep learning systems. First looking at the simplest form of supervised neural networks, then exploring how variations such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks can improve the efficacy of such systems, we demonstrate that most deep learning systems are not designed with security and resiliency in mind, and can be duped by any patient attacker with a good understanding of the system. [3] The efficacy of applications using machine learning should not only be measured with precision and recall, but also by their malleability in an adversarial setting. After diving into popular deep learning software, we show how it can be tampered with to do what you want it do, while avoiding detection by system administrators.\n\nBesides giving a technical demonstration of deep learning and its inherent shortcomings in an adversarial setting, we will focus on tampering real systems to show real weaknesses in critical systems built with it. In particular, this demo-driven session will be focused on manipulating an image recognition and speech recognition system built with deep learning at the core, and exploring the difficulties in attacking systems in the wild. By discussing defensive measures that should be put in place to prevent the class of attacks demonstrated, we hope to address the hype behind deep learning from the context of security, and look towards a more resilient future of the technology where developers can more safely use it in critical applications.\n\nClarence Chio graduated with a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford University, specializing in data mining and artificial intelligence. He currently works as a Research Data Engineer at Shape Security, a startup in Silicon Valley building a product that protects from malicious bots and automated attacks on Global 2000 customers. At Shape, he works on the big data analysis systems that are used to tackle this problem. Clarence spoke on Machine Learning and Security at PHDays 2015 in Moscow, BSides Las Vegas 2015, Code Blue Tokyo 2015, SecTor Toronto 2015, and BSides NYC 2016. He had been a community speaker with Intel, and is also the founder and organizer of the ‘Data Mining for Cyber Security’ meet-up group, the largest gathering of security data analysis professionals in the San Francisco Bay Area.",

Hours of productivity were replaced with rage and frustration as unwitting computer users were confronted with fake Blue Screens of Death and revolting ASCII art. But, the world has changed. The machines have risen in capability. HDMI is the graphical transmission protocol of choice and hacking with micro-controllers is standard issue. The as-seen-on-HDTV duo of Joe Grand and Zoz return with the next generation of mischievous hardware, a device that supplants or captures any inline HDMI signal in a discreet, pentest-worthy package. BSODomizer HD is an FPGA-based system that not only improves on the graphics interception and triggering features of its predecessor, but can now capture screenshots of a target system and also provides a fully open design that you can use for your own experiments into the mystical world of massive, customizable arrays of digital logic. We'll guide you through the process of going from lamer zero to hacker hero with FPGAs, while savagely fucking with a few unfortunate friends along the way!\n\nJoe Grand, also known as Kingpin, is a computer engineer, hardware hacker, former DEF CON badge designer, runner, daddy, honorary doctor, TV host, member of L0pht Heavy Industries, and the proprietor of Grand Idea Studio. \n\nTwitter: @joegrand Zoz is a robotics engineer, prankster, and renaissance hacker.

            "description": "Introduction the Wichcraft Compiler Collection : Towards Universal Code Theft\nJonathan Brossard (endrazine) Master of Darkness, MOABI.com\n\nWith this presentation, we take a new approach to reverse engineering. Instead of attempting to decompile code, we seek to undo the work of the linker and produce relocatable files, the typical output of a compiler. The main benefit of the later technique over the former being that it does work. Once achieved universal code ‘reuse’ by relinking those relocatable objects as arbitrary shared libraries, we'll create a form of binary reflection, add scripting capabilities and in memory debugging using a JIT compiler, to attain automated API prototyping and annotation, which, we will argue, constitutes a primary form of binary code self awareness. Finally, we'll see how abusing the dynamic linker internals shall elegantly solve a number of complex tasks for us, such as calling a given function within a binary without having to craft a valid input to reach it. \n\nThe applications in terms of vulnerability exploitation, functional testing, static analysis validation and more generally computer wizardry being tremendous, we'll have fun demoing some new exploits in real life applications, and commit public program profanity, such as turing PEs into ELFs, functional scripting of sshd in memory, stealing crypto routines without even disassembling them, among other things that were never supposed to work. All the above techniques have been implemented into the Wichcraft Compiler Collection, to be released as proper open source software (MIT/BSD-2 licenses) exclusively at DEF CON 24.\n\nJonathan Brossard is a computer whisperer from France, although he's been living in Brazil, India, Australia and now lives in San Francisco. For his first conference at DEF CON 16, he hacked Microsoft Bitlocker, McAffee Endpoint and a fair number of BIOS Firmwares. During his second presentation at DEF CON 20, he presented Rakshasa, a BIOS malware based on open source software, the MIT Technology review labeled &lquo;incurable and undetectable&rquo;. \n\nThis year will be his third DEF CON ... Endrazine is also known in the community for having run the Hackito Ergo Sum and NoSuchCon conferences in France, participating to the Shakacon Program Committee in Hawaii, and authoring a number of exploits over the past decade.

We may ask ourselves: what does smart mean? It is the possibility of building systems which are nodes of a more complex network, digitally connected to the internet and to the final users. Our cities are becoming one of those networks and over time more and more elements are getting connected to such network: from traffic lights to information signs, from traffic and surveillance cameras to transport systems.\n\nThis last element, also called as Smart Mobility is the subject of our analysis, divided in three sub-element, each one describing a different method of transport in our city: Private transport: for this method we analyze the smart alternatives aimed to make parking activity easy, hassle free and more convenient Shared transport: we focus our attention on those systems which are sharing transport vehicles. In particular we deal with bike sharing which seems to be the most wide spread system in European cities Public transport: object of our analysis for this section is the bus, metro and tram network The aim of our analysis is understanding the ecosystem which each element belongs to and performing a security evaluation of such system. In this way the most plausible attack and fraud scenarios are pointed out and the presence of proper security measures is checked.\n\nAll the details discussed here are collected from a sample city, but the same methodology and concept can be applied to most of the smart cities in the world.\n\nMatteo Beccaro is a security researcher, enrolled in Computer Engineering at Politecnico of Turin. He's co-founder and CTO of Opposing Force s.r.l., the first Italian offensive physical security company. Matteo works and researches on network protocols, NFC and EACS security.

OSD, or on-screen-display controllers are ubiquitous components in nearly all modern monitors. OSDs are typically used to generate simple menus on the monitor, allowing the user to change settings like brightness, contrast and input source. However, OSDs are effectively independent general-purpose computers that can: read the content of the screen, change arbitrary pixel values, and execute arbitrary code supplied through numerous control channels. We demonstrate multiple methods of loading and executing arbitrary code in a modern monitor and discuss the security implication of this novel attack vector. \n\nWe also present a thorough analysis of an OSD system used in common Dell monitors and discuss attack scenarios ranging from active screen content manipulation and screen content snooping to active data exfiltration using Funtenna-like techniques. We demonstrate a multi-stage monitor implant capable of loading arbitrary code and data encoded in specially crafted images and documents through active monitor snooping. This code infiltration technique can be implemented through a single pixel, or through subtle variations of a large number of pixels. We discuss a step-by-step walk-through of our hardware and software reverse-analysis process of the Dell monitor. We present three demonstrations of monitoring exploitation to show active screen snooping, active screen content manipulation and covert data exfiltration using Funtenna. \n\nLastly, we discuss realistic attack delivery mechanisms, show a prototype implementation of our attack using the USB Armory and outline potential attack mitigation options. We will release sample code related to this attack prior to the presentation date.\n\nDr. Ang Cui is the Founder and Chief Scientist of Red Balloon Security.

In this talk I will explore and demonstrate how it is possible to take total control of operating system kernels by DMA code injection. Once control of the kernel has been gained I will execute code and dump gigabytes of memory in seconds. Full disk encryption will be defeated, authentication will be bypassed and shells will be spawned. This will all be made possible using a $100 piece of hardware together with the easy to use modular PCILeech toolkit - which will be published as open source after this talk.\n\nUlf Frisk is a penetration tester working in the Swedish financial sector.

Code complicity techniques are usually used just to increase the time and effort needed for reverse engineering. The desired effect of code complicity can be magnified using mechanisms that decrease and narrow the allowed time frame for any reverse engineering attempt into few milliseconds. Such approach can be applied using a metamorphic engine that is aware of the time dimension. Beyond metamorphic applications for AV evasion, in this talk, we will present a novel approach to resist and evade reverse engineering using a remote metamorphic engine that generates diversified morphed machine code of a very short expiration lifetime. Our approach is based on a client-server model using challenge-response communication protocol made of morphed machine code rather than data. We will show how any reverse engineering attempt on such model will be forced to execute or emulate the morphed code. Thus the code will always have an upper hand to detect, evade and attack the reverse engineering environment. Our approach is immune to static code analysis as the functionalities and the communication protocol used are dynamically diversified remotely and do not exist in packed executable files. On the other hand, clock synchronized morphed machine code driven by a remote metamorphic engine would trap dynamic RE attempts in the maze of metamorphism. One that is immune to code tampering and reversing by detecting the non-self. We will present the fundamental difference between metamorphic and polymorphic techniques used to evade AV compared to the ones that can be used to resist RE. We will show how a remote diversified metamorphic self-modifying code with a very short expiration lifetime can detect, evade, and resist any code analysis, reverse engineering, machine learning and tampering attempts.\n\nAmro Abdelgawad is a security researcher and the founder of Immuneye. He has more than 15 years experience in software security and reverse engineering. He has experienced both sides of software security in vulnerability researching, penetration testing, reverse engineering, exploit development and the defensive side as a chief security officer for software companies running wide infrastructures. Amro is currently working as a security researcher where his main interests are analyzing malware, vulnerability researching and developing artificial software immunity.",

By pretending to be a controller connected to a game console, TASBot triggers glitches and exploits weaknesses to execute arbitrary opcodes and rewrite games. This talk will cover how these exploits were found and will explore the idea that breaking video games using Tool-Assisted emulators can be a fun way to learn the basics of discovering security vulnerabilities. After a brief overview of video game emulators and the tools they offer, I'll show a live demo of how the high accuracy of these emulators makes it possible to create a frame-by-frame sequence of button presses accurate enough to produce the same results even on real hardware. After demonstrating beating a game quickly I'll show how the same tools can be used to find exploitable weaknesses in a game's code that can be used to trigger an Arbitrary Code Execution, ultimately treating the combination of buttons being pressed as opcodes. Using this ability, I'll execute a payload that will connect a console directly to the internet and will allow the audience to interact with it. An overview of some of the details that will be described in the talk can be found in an article I coauthored for the PoC||GTFO journal (Pokemon Plays Twitch, page 6 ).\n\nAllan Cecil (dwangoAC) is the President of the North Bay Linux User's Group. He acts as an ambassador for Tasvideos.org, a website devoted to using emulators to complete video games as quickly as the hardware allows. He participates in Games Done Quick charity speedrunning marathons using TASBot to entertain viewers with never-before-seen glitches in games. By day, he is a senior engineer at Ciena Corporation working on OpenStack Network Functions Virtualization orchestration and Linux packet performance optimization testing.\n\nTwitter: @MrTASBot\nTwitch.TV: dwangoac \nYouTube: dwangoac",

As teledildonics come into the mainstream, human sexual pleasure has become connected with the concerns of privacy and security already familiar to those who previously only wanted to turn on their lights, rather than their lover. Do you care if someone else knows if you or your lover is wearing a remote control vibrator? Do you care if the manufacturer is tracking your activity, sexual health and to whom you give control? How do you really know who is making you squirm with pleasure? And what happens when your government decides your sex toy is an aid to political dissidents? Because there’s nothing more sexy than reverse engineering we looked into one product (the We-Vibe 4 Plus from the innocuously named “Standard Innovation Corporation”) to get answers for you.\n\nAttend our talk to learn the unexpected political and legal implications of internet connected sex toys and, perhaps more importantly, how you can explore and gain more control over the intimate devices in your life. Learn the reverse engineering approach we took--suitable for both first timers and the more experienced--to analyze a product that integrates a Bluetooth LE/Smart wireless hardware device, mobile app and server-side functionality. More parts means more attack surfaces! Alongside the talk, we are releasing the “Weevil” suite of tools to enable you to simulate and control We-Vibe compatible vibrators. We invite you to bring your knowledge of mobile app exploits, wireless communication hijacking (you already hacked your electronic skateboard last year, right?) and back-end server vulnerabilities to the party. It’s time for you to get to play with your toys more privately and creatively than before. \n\nPlease note: This talk contains content related to human sexuality but does not contain sexually explicit material. The presenters endorse the DEF CON Code of Conduct and human decency in relation to matters of consent--attendees are welcome in the audience if they do the same. Keep the good vibes. :)\n\nfollower talks with computers and humans. Six years after first speaking at DEF CON about vulnerabilities in the Internet of Things, the fad hasn’t blown over so is back doing it again. An interest in code and hardware has lead to Arduino networking and USB projects and teaching others how to get started with Arduino. Tim O'Reilly once called follower a ‘troublemaker’ for his Google Maps reverse engineering. \n\nTwitter: @rancidbacon\n\ngoldfisk spins fire by night and catches up with computer science lectures, also by night. And wishes headphone cables would stop getting caught on stuff. An interest in reverse engineering can be blamed on a childhood playing with electronics and re-implementing browser games in Scratch. \n\nTwitter: @goldfisk",

This generally requires access to an execution environment capable of supporting the machine code being studied, both at an architectural level (CPU type) and a packaging level (file container type). Unfortunately, this is not always a simple matter. The majority of analysts do not have a full complement of hosts available to support a wide variety of architectures, and virtualization opportunities for non-intel platforms are limited. In this talk we will discuss a light weight emulator framework for the IDA Pro disassembler that is based on the Unicorn emulation engine. The goal of the project is to provide an embedded multi-architectural emulation capability to complement IDA Pro's multi-architectural disassembly capability to enhance the versatility of one of the most common reverse engineering tools in use today.\n\nChris Eagle is a registered hex offender. He has been taking software apart since he first learned to put it together over 35 years ago. His research interests include computer network operations, malware analysis and reverse/anti-reverse engineering techniques. He is the author of The IDA Pro Book and has published a number of well-known IDA plug-ins. He is also a co-author of Gray Hat Hacking. He has spoken at numerous conferences including Black Hat, DEF CON , Shmoocon, and ToorCon. Chris also organized and led the Sk3wl of r00t to two DEF CON Capture the Flag championships and produced that competition for four years as part of the DDTEK organization.\n\nTwitter: @sk3wl",

Despite the continued popularity of these single-cup coffee conjurers at home as well as in the workplace, it has become clear that these devices are not impervious to mechanical and/or electrical failure. It was this intersection of extremely prevalent hardware and relatively short lifespan that prompted me to begin exploring the upper limits of what could be created by repurposing one of the most popular pod-based machines: the Keurig. In this session, we will walk through some real-world examples of ‘MacGyver’-style creative problem-solving, we'll go hands on (yes, pun intended) with stuff made from repurposed Keurigs, and finally, I'll reflect on lessons learned from looking for potential in things most people deem common and unremarkable.\n\nEvan Booth loves to build stuff out of other stuff. As an engineer for Skookum, a full service software development company in Charlotte, North Carolina, he works to solve a variety of business problems through the creative use of technology. As a human for Earth, he tends to break things for curiosity's sake. Throughout 2013 and into 2014, in an effort to highlight hypocrisy and ‘security theater’ brought about by the TSA, through a research project called ‘Terminal Cornucopia,’ Evan created an arsenal ranging from simple, melee weapons to reloadable firearms to remotely-trigger incendiary suitcases—all solely comprised of items that anyone can purchase inside most airport terminals *after* the security checkpoint. Given the right ingredients, a big cardboard box can be a time machine, spaceship, minecart, or a telephone booth that only calls people named ‘Steve’ who live in the future. \n\nTwitter: @evanbooth",

This is welcomed as the CAN protocol is becoming the backbone for embedded computers found in smartcars. Its use is now even spreading outside the car through the OBD-II connector: usage-based policies from insurance companies, air-pollution control from law enforcement or engine diagnostics from smartphones for instance. Nonetheless, these tools will do no more than what professional tools from automobile manufacturers can do. In fact, they will do less as they do not have knowledge of upper-layer protocols. Security auditors are used to deal with this kind of situation: they reverse-engineer protocols before implementing them on top of their tool of choice. However, to be efficient at this, they need more than just being able to listen to or interact with what they are auditing. Precisely, they need to be able to intercept communications and block them, forward them or modify them on the fly. This is why, for example, a framework such as Burp Suite is popular when it comes to auditing web applications. In this paper, we present CANSPY, a framework giving security auditors such capabilities when auditing CAN devices. Not only can it block, forward or modify CAN frames on the fly, it can do so autonomously with a set of rules or interactively using Ethernet and a packet manipulation framework such as Scapy.\n\nIt is also worth noting that it was designed to be cheap and easy to build as it is mostly made of inexpensive COTS. Last but not least, we demonstrate its versatility by turning around a security issue usually considered when it comes to cars: instead of auditing an electronic control unit (ECU) through the OBD-II connector, we are going to partially emulate ECUs in order to audit a device that connects to this very connector.\n\nJonathan-Christofer Demay, PhD is the current penetration testing team leader at AIRBUS Defence and Space. As a former academic researcher, he has been working on IDS bypassing, intrusion detection and general network security. Now a consultant for various key industries and government bodies, he is working on incident response, penetration testing and social engineering. \n\nArnaud Lebrun is a command and control engineer currently working at AIRBUS Defence and Space. He is focusing on security issues for several projects in the aerospace industry and related areas such as radioactive waste disposal facilities or large telescopes. He also supports the penetration testing team for perimeters that include ICS infrastructures or embedded electronics.",

When developers have done their job well you'll find JTAG locked-up, non-responsive serial ports, locked-down uboot, and perhaps even a home brewed secure-boot solution. In this session you'll learn details of a useful hardware/software penetration technique to attempt when you've run out of easier options. We've used this technique on two commercial device security assessments successfully and have refined the technique on a series of test devices in the lab. This session will cover the prerequisites for successful application of the technique and give you helpful hints to help your hack! Best of all this technique, while a bit risky to the hardware, is easy to try and doesn't require specialized equipment or hardware modification. We are going to take pieces of metal and stab them at the heart of the hardware and see what happens. For the hardware/firmware developer you'll get a checklist that you can use to reduce your vulnerability to this sort of attack.\n\nBrad Dixon once told his parents that if they gave him a Commodore 64 it would be the last computer he'd ever want. He never got that Commodore 64. Nevertheless Brad managed to become a computer nerd at a young age. Brad studied Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech and jumped into embedded software engineering. He worked for many years helping developers to design embedded Linux into telecom, network, and mobile products.

            "description": "Universal Serial aBUSe: Remote Physical Access Attacks\nRogan Dawes Researcher, Sensepost\nDominic White CTO, SensePost\n\nIn this talk, we’ll cover some novel USB-level attacks, that can provide stealthy remote access to a machine’s console, and release a toolset using freely available hardware. In 2000, Microsoft published its 10 Immutable laws of security. One of which was ‘if a bad guy has unrestricted access to your computer, it's not your computer anymore.’ This has been robustly demonstrated over the years. Examples include numerous DMA-access attacks against interfaces such as firewire, PCMCIA and thunderbolt as well as USB-based attacks including simple in-line keyloggers, ‘evil maid‘ attacks and malicious firmware. Despite these warnings, groups such as the NSA were still able to use physical access to bypass software controls with toolsets such as COTTONMOUTH. Likewise, criminals have been able to defraud banks with a handful of simple hardware tricks. While some progress has been made to secure some devices against some threats, such as the use of full disc encryption, or the impact of Apple's secure enclave in the physical security of the iPhone, most laptops and desktops remain vulnerable to attacks via physical interfaces. In our experience, organizations merely view USB devices as a channel for malware or unsanctioned communications, and rely on protections placed elsewhere in their defensive stack to deal with them, but few deal with the risk the USB interface presents directly. There are many scenarios where gaining physical access to hosts is plausible, and having done so can provide access to ‘chewy’ internal networks ripe for lateral movement. While most people are familiar with USB devices, many don't realize the extent to which the USB standard allows seemingly innocuous devices to have multiple personalities. The most common attack is to have devices implement keyboard and mouse functionality, allowing an attacker to execute a pre-programmed sequence of keystrokes and mouse movements at some point after the device has been plugged in. An implementation of this is commercially available in the form of the ‘Rubber Ducky‘ device (limited to keystroke injection only) or the USBdriveby toolset (keystroke and mouse movement injection). However, these attacks are ‘send only’ and usually rely on the executed payload and the host’s networks for any advanced remote access. These payloads can leave a significant forensic footprint in the form of network communications and on-host behaviors, with numerous companies improving toolsets to detect such attacks. Lastly, these attacks are often lsquo;spray and pray’, unable to account for variations in the user's behavior or computer setup. For example, what happens if the user plugs in the device while the screen is locked, and how would you know what the cause of the failure was? Our approach is to create a stealthy bi-directional channel between the host and device, with remote connectivity via 3G/Wi-Fi and offload the complexity to our hardware, leaving a small simple stub to run on the host. This talk will discuss the process of creating a set of malicious USB devices using low cost hardware. The design and toolkit will be released during the talk. Our toolkit provides three significant improvements over the common USB attacks. The first is the ability to gain a bi-directional channel with the host via the device with no traffic generated on the target network. This is done via the use of either a standard USB class printer or audio device driver linked to our device, with the stub merely wrapping commands and outputs encoded as audio or print instructions. The second is the ability to communicate with the device remotely via Wi-Fi/3G, allowing for updates to the payloads, exfiltration of data, real-time interaction with the host and an ability to debug problems. This also has the advantage that any network controls are bypassed. Finally, the stub running on the host will leave a minimal forensic trail, making detection of the attack, or analysis of it later, difficult. Our hope is that the tools will provide a method of demonstrating the risk of physical bypasses of software security without an NSA budget, and encourage defenses to be built in this area.\n\nRogan Dawes is a senior researcher at SensePost and has been hacking since 1998, which, coincidentally, is also the time he settled on a final wardrobe.

Rogan spent many years building web application assessment tools, and is credited as having built one of the first and most widely used intercepting proxies; WebScarab. In recent years, Rogan has turned his attentions towards hardware hacking; and these days many suspect him to be at least part cyborg.

Remote cyber intrusions at three Ukrainian regional electric power distribution companies in December 2015 left approximately 225,000 customers without power. Malware, like BlackEnergy, is being specially developed to target supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Specifically, adversaries are focusing their efforts on obtaining access to the human-machine interface (HMI) solutions that act as the main hub for managing the operation of the control system. Vulnerabilities in these SCADA HMI solutions are, and will continue to be, highly valuable as we usher in this new era of software exploitation. This talk covers an in-depth analysis performed on a corpus of 200+ confirmed SCADA HMI vulnerabilities. It details out the popular vulnerability types discovered in HMI solutions developed by the biggest SCADA vendors, including Schneider Electric, Siemens, General Electric, and Advantech. It studies the weaknesses in the technologies used to develop HMI solutions and describes how critical vulnerabilities manifest in the underlying code. The talk will compare the time-to-patch performance of various SCADA vendors along with a comparison of the SCADA industry to the rest of the software industry. Finally, using the data presented, additional guidance will be provided to SCADA researchers along with a prediction on what we expect next in attacks that leverage SCADA HMI vulnerabilities.\n\nBrian Gorenc is the senior manager of Vulnerability Research with Trend Micro.

Detection methods haven't evolved to be as fast and easy to implement. Wireless situational awareness has a number of challenges. Categorically, these challenges are usually classified under Time, Money, or a lot of both. Provisioning sensors takes time, and the fast stuff usually isn’t cheap. Iterative improvements compound the problem when you need to get software updates to multiple devices in the field. I’ll present a prototype platform for GSM anomaly detection (called SITCH) which uses cloud-delivered services to elegantly deploy, manage, and coordinate the information from many independent wireless telemetry sensors (IoT FTW). We’ll talk about options and trade-offs when selecting sensor hardware, securing your sensors, using cloud services for orchestrating firmware, and how to collect and make sense of the data you’ve amassed. Source code for the prototype will be released as well. The target audience for this lecture is the hacker/tinkerer type with strong systems and network experience. A very basic understanding of GSM networks is a plus, but not required.\n\nAshmastaflash is a native of southeast Tennessee and a recent transplant to San Francisco.

We found several seismographs in production connected to the public internet providing graphs and data to anyone who connects to the embed web server running at port 80. The seismographs provide real time data based in the perturbations from earth and surroundings, we consider this as a critical infrastructure and is clear the lack of protection and implementation by the technicians in charge. \n\nWe are going to present 3 ways to exploit the seismograph which is segmented in 3 parts: Modem (GSM, Wi-Fi, Satellite, GPS,Com serial) {web server running at port 80 , ssh daemon} Sensor (Device collecting the data from ground or ocean bottom) Battery (1 year lifetime) Apollo server (MAIN acquisition core server) These vulnerabilities affect the Modem which is directly connected to the sensor , a remote connection to the modem it's all that you need to compromise the whole seismograph network. After got the root shell our goal is execute a post exploitation attack , This specific attack corrupts/modifies the whole seismological research data of a country/ area in real time.

You’ve never done this for work before, you’ve got a week to do it, and you figure that’s plenty of time. Then someone objects to the pretext at the last minute. Or spam filters block everything. Or you decide to send slowly, to avoid detection, but the third recipient alerts the entire company. Or you can only find 5 target addresses. We’ve all been there on our first professional phishing exercise. What should be as easy as building a two page web site and writing a clever e-mail turns into a massively frustrating exercise with a centi-scaled corpus of captured credentials. In this talk, we’ll tell you how to win at phishing, from start to finish, particularly in hacking Layer 8, the “Politics” layer of the OSI stack that’s part of any professional phishing engagement. We’ll share stories of many of our experiences, which recently included an investigation opened with the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC). Finally, we’ll tell you how we stopped feeling frustrated, learned to handle the politics, and produced successful phishing campaigns that hardened organizations at the human layer, and started to screw things up for the bad actors.\n\nJay Beale has created several security tools, including Bastille Linux/UNIX and the CIS Linux Scoring Tool, both of which have been used throughout industry and government. He has served as an invited speaker, program chair and trainer at many industry and government conferences, a columnist for Information Security Magazine, SecurityPortal and SecurityFocus, and a contributor to nine books, including those in his Open Source Security Series and the ‘Stealing the Network’ series.

Attribution Analysis Through Arrest History\nJake Kouns CISO, Risk Based Security\n\nThere have been over 20,000 data breaches disclosed exposing over 4.8 billion records, with over 4,000 breaches in 2015 alone. It is clear there is no slowdown at all and the state of security is embarrassing. The total cybercrime cost estimates have been astronomical and law enforcement has been struggling to track down even a fraction of the criminals, as usual. \n\nAttribution in computer compromises continues to be a surprisingly complex task that ultimately isn’t definitive in most cases. Rather than focusing on learning from security issues and how companies can avoid these sorts of data breaches in the future, for most media outlets the main topic after a breach continues to be attribution. And if we are honest, the media have painted an “interesting” and varied picture of “hackers” over the years, many of which have caused collective groans or outright rage from the community. \n\nThe Arrest Tracker project was started in 2011 as a way to track arrests from all types of “cyber” (drink!) and hacking related incidents. This project aims to track computer intrusion incidents resulting in an arrest, detaining of a person or persons, seizure of goods, or other related activities that are directly linked to computer crimes. \n\nThe Arrest Tracker project currently has 936 arrests collected as of 4/23/2016. How does tracking this information help and what does the data tell us? A lot actually! Who is behind these data breaches and what are the demographics such as average age, gender, and nationality? Which day of the week are you most likely to be arrested? How many arrests lead to assisting authorities to arrest others? How many work by themselves versus part of a group? These observations, and a lot more, paint an interesting picture of the computer crime landscape.\n\nJake Kouns is the CISO for Risk Based Security that provides vulnerability and data breach intelligence. He has presented at many well-known security conferences including DEF CON , Black Hat, DerbyCon, FIRST, CanSecWest, RSA, SOURCE, SyScan and many more. He is the co-author of the book Information Technology Risk Management in Enterprise Environments, Wiley, 2010 and The Chief Information Security Officer, IT Governance, 2011. With all of that said, many people are shocked to find out that he has a CISO title, and many others can’t believe that he has been attending DEF CON since the good old days of Alexis Park! \n\nTwitter: @jkouns\nRisk Based Security",

This talk will examine the history of iOS’s exploit mitigations from iOS 8 to iOS 9.3 in order to teach important features of the architecture. This talk will cover various enhancements that stop attackers from dynamically modifying the functionality of system services, but also resulted in the defeat of all known exploitation through function hooking. Additionally, we will explore how the ability to use PLT interception and the use of direct memory overwrite are no longer options for exploit writers because of recent changes.

But in the wake of Paris and San Bernardino, there is increasing pressure from law enforcement and policy makers, both here and abroad, to mandate so-called backdoors in encryption products. In this presentation, I will discuss in brief the history of the first Crypto Wars, and the state of the law coming into 2016. I will then discuss what happened in the fight between Apple and the FBI in San Bernardino and the current proposals to weaken or ban encryption, covering proposed and recently enacted laws in New York, California, Australia, India, and the UK. Finally, I will discuss possible realistic outcomes to the Second Crypto Wars, and give my predictions on what the State of the Law will be at the end of 2016.\n\nNate Cardozo is a Senior Staff Attorney on the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s digital civil liberties team.

But what steps do most of us take in sanitizing the input that is read into the computer systems known as our brains? This presentation will go over the attack vector that is known as Propaganda. By studying works such as Manufacturing Consent (by Noam Chomsky and Ed Herman) we can learn of the various manipulations that happen to media before it reaches the end reader. \n\nArmed with the knowledge of how propaganda works, a person could attempt a more healthy diet of media consumption. Computer and data networks are heavily utilized by those wishing to push agendas, but who is to say these same technologies can not be utilized to fight back? Developers have access to all sorts of tools that help accomplish this feat, such as web scrapers, natural language tool kits, or even the reddit source code repository. This talk will walk the audience through some different techniques that can be used for better media consumption.\n\nThe Bob Ross Fan Club is currently working as a security software engineer for embedded linux systems.

But current security apps not only scan for malware, they also aid end users by detecting malicious URLs, scams or phishing attacks.\n\nGenerally, security apps appear so self-evidently useful that institutions such as online-banking providers even require users to install anti-virus programs. In this talk, however, we show that the installation of security applications, at least in the context of smartphones, can sometimes open the phone to a number of attack vectors, making the system more instead of less vulnerable to attacks. \n\nIn a recent research we conducted on Android security apps from renowned vendors such as Kaspersky, McAfee, Androhelm, Eset, Malwarebytes or Avira. When conducting a study of the apps’ security features (Antivirus and Privacy Protection, Device Protection, Secure Web Browsing, etc.) it came as a shock to us that every inspected application contained critical vulnerabilities, and that in the end no single of the promoted security features proved to be sufficiently secure. In a simple case, we would have been able to harm the app vendor’s business model by upgrading a trial version into a premium one at no charge. \n\nIn other instances, attackers would be able to harm the end user by completely disabling the malware-scanning engine remotely. Or how about accessing confidential data by exploiting broken SSL communication, broken self-developed “advanced” crypto implementations or through SQL-injections?\n\nYes, we can. On top, we were able to bypass the secure browsing protection and abuse it for code execution. The most alarming findings, however, were security applications that we were able to actually turn into a remote access trojan (RAT) or into ransomware. In light of all those findings, one must seriously question whether the advice to install a security app onto one’s smartphone is a wise one. In this talk, we will not only explain our findings in detail but also propose possible security fixes.\n\nStephan Huber is a security researcher at the testlab mobile security group at the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (SIT). His main focus is Android application security testing and developing new static and dynamic analysis techniques for app security evaluation. He found different vulnerabilities in well-known Android applications and the AOSP. In his spare time he enjoys teaching students in Android hacking.\n\nSiegfried Rasthofer is a fourth year PhD student at the TU Darmstadt (Germany) and Fraunhofer SIT and his main research focus is on applied software security on Android applications. He developed different tools that combine static and dynamic code analysis for security purposes. He likes to break Android applications and found various AOSP exploits. Most of his research is published at top tier academic conferences and very recently he started publishing at industry conferences like BlackHat, VirusBulletin or AVAR.\n\n",

Hacking boarding passes for fun and profit.\nPrzemek Jaroszewski CERT Polska/NASK\n\nWhile traveling through airports, we usually don't give a second thought about why our boarding passes are scanned at various places. After all, it's all for the sake of passengers' security. Or is it? The fact that boarding pass security is broken has been proven many times by researchers who easily crafted their passes, effectively bypassing not just ‘passenger only’ screening, but also no-fly lists. Since then, not only security problems have not been solved, but boarding passes have become almost entirely bar-coded. And they are increasingly often checked by machines rather than humans. Effectively, we're dealing with simple unencrypted strings of characters containing all the information needed to decide on our eligibility for fast lane access, duty-free shopping, and more... \n\nWith a set of easily available tools, boarding pass hacking is easier than ever, and the checks are mostly a security theater. In my talk, I will discuss in depth how the boarding pass information is created, encoded and validated. I will demonstrate how easy it is to craft own boarding pass that works perfectly at most checkpoints (and explain why it doesn't work at other ones). \n\nI will also discuss IATA recommendations, security measures implemented in boarding passes (such as digital signatures) and their (in)effectiveness, as well as responses I got from different institutions involved in handling boarding passes. There will be some fun, as well as some serious questions that I don't necessarily have good answers to.\n\nPrzemek Jaroszewski is a member of CERT Polska (part of Research and Academic Computer Network in Poland) since 2001, where his current position is the head of incident response.

Rogue cell towers, which can be as small as your home router, pose a large security risk to anyone with a phone. If in range, your phone will automatically connect to the rogue tower with no indication to you that anything has happened. At that point, your information passes through the rogue tower and can leak sensitive information about you and your device. Currently, there are no easy ways to protect your phone from connecting to a rogue tower (aside from some Android apps which are phone specific and require root access). In this talk I'll demonstrate how you can create a rogue cell tower detector using generic hardware available from Amazon. The detector can identify rogue towers and triangulate their location. The demonstration uses a software defined radio (SDR) to fingerprint each cell tower and determine the signal strength of each tower relative to the detector. With a handful of these detectors working together, you can identify when a rogue cell tower enters your airspace, as well as identify the signal strength relative to each detector. This makes it possible to triangulate the source of the new rogue cell tower.\n\nJusticeBeaver (Eric Escobar) is a Security Engineer at Barracuda Networks. His interests are broad and generally include putting computers in places you wouldn't expect. From chicken coops to rockets and even bee hives. Before being called to the dark side, Eric procured a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Civil Engineering. He now enjoys all things wireless, from WiFi, to SDR, and Ham Radio.

And we've all struggled with the limitations those systems put on us in the form of available tools or software we want to use. I didn't like struggling, so I came up with a method to load whatever I wanted on to a closed system without triggering any common security alerts. To do this I had to avoid accessing the Internet or using mag media. In the end all I needed was an office multi-function machine and Excel. It's all any insider needs. \n\nFor my presentation and demo, I'll show you how I delivered a select group of PowerSploit tools to a clean, isolated machine. Of course, Excel has been known as vector for macro viruses for quite some time and some of the techniques--such as hex-encoding binary data and re-encoding it on a target machine--are known binary insertion vectors but I have not found any prior work on an insider using these techniques to deliver payloads to closed systems. You'll leave my presentation knowing why Excel, umm, excels as an insider attack tool, how to leverage Excel features to load and extract arbitrary binary data from a closed network, and what to do if this really frightens you.\n\nMike has over 20 years experience in the military. He has been part of everything from systems acquisition, to tactical intelligence collection, to staff work, to leading a unit dedicated to data loss prevention.

Plus there are all sorts of non-technical things that established researchers seem to just know. There are many different things to learn, but nobody really talks about the different paths you can take on your journey. We will provide an overview of key concepts in vulnerability research, then cover where you can go to learn more - and what to look for. We’ll suggest ways for you to choose what you analyze and provide tools and techniques you might want to use. We’ll discuss different disclosure models (only briefly, we promise!), talk about the different kinds of responses to expect from vendors, and give some advice on how to write useful advisories and how to go about publishing them. Then, we’ll finish up by covering some of the ‘mindset’ of vulnerability research, including skills and personality traits that contribute to success, the different stages of growth that many researchers follow, and the different feelings (yes, FEELINGS) that researchers can face along the way. Our end goal is to help you improve your chances of career success, so you can get a sense of where you are, where you want to go, and what you might want to do to get there. We will not dig too deeply into technical details, and we’d go so far as to say that some kinds of vulnerability research do not require deep knowledge anyway. Vulnerability research isn’t for everyone, but after this talk, maybe you’ll have a better sense of whether it’s right for you, and what to expect going forward.\n\nJoshua J.

Now, having our own Macro BaseStation (an eNodeB) on the desk, we will demonstrate practical approaches to and attacks on real life devices. More and more devices are using mobile radio networks such as GSM, UMTS and LTE and there has already been quite a bit of research on (in)securities on the radio part, but only few people have had a look behind the scenes. Luckily, we had the chance to have just this look and now we would like to raise the curtain for the community. Initially we will quickly cover our complete odyssey from starting up an eNodeB for the first time, checking out the available interfaces and emulating the core network through to starting attacks. In the main part of the talk we will give a rather practical insight into the (in-)security features of basestations. We will start with valid backend connections and how these connections can be abused to reconfigure both a single eNodeB and a complete subnet on a telco network. We will then continue with the ‘official’ maintenance approach with the vendor's tools and webinterfaces giving an attacker both local and remote access to the device. All in all the talk will cover general and specific vulnerabilities in both basestations and the backend network.\n\nHendrik Schmidt and Brian Butterly are seasoned security researchers with vast experiences in large and complex enterprise networks. Over the years they focused on evaluating and reviewing all kinds of network protocols and applications. They love to play with packets and use them for their own purposes. In this context they learned how to play around with telecommunication networks, wrote protocol fuzzers and spoofers for testing their implementation and security architecture. Both are pentesters and consultants at the German based ERNW GmbH and will happily share their knowledge with the audience.",

Devices that once only existed in the tangible world are now accessible by anyone with a network connection. Even physical security systems, a significant part of any large organization’s overall security posture, are being given network interfaces to make management and access more convenient. But that convenience also significantly increases the risk of attack, and hacks that were once thought to only exist in movies, like opening a building’s doors from a laptop or modifying a camera feed live, are now possible and even easy to pull off. In this talk, we will discuss this new attack surface and demonstrate various ways an attacker can circumvent and compromise devices such as door controllers, security cameras, and motion sensors over the network, as well as ways to protect yourself from such attacks.\n\nRicky ‘HeadlessZeke’ Lawshae has spent the better part of the last decade voiding warranties and annoying vendors for both business and pleasure.

Although promising and proving safety features, the trustworthiness of these cars has to be examined before they can be widely adopted on the road. Unlike traditional network security, autonomous vehicles rely heavily on their sensory ability of their surroundings to make driving decision, which opens a new security risk. Thus, in this talk we examine the security of the sensors of autonomous vehicles, and investigate the trustworthiness of the 'eyes' of the cars. In this talk, we investigate sensors whose measurements are used to guide driving, i.e., millimeter-wave radars, ultrasonic sensors, forward-looking cameras. In particular, we present contactless attacks on these sensors and show our results collected both in the lab and outdoors on a Tesla Model S automobile. We show that using off-the-shelf hardware, we are able to perform jamming and spoofing attacks, which caused the Tesla's blindness and malfunction, all of which could potentially lead to crashes and greatly impair the safety of self-driving cars. To alleviate the issues, at the end of the talk we propose software and hardware countermeasures that will improve sensor resilience against these attacks.\n\nJianhao Liu is the director of ADLAB at Qihoo 360. He specializes in the security of Internet of Things and Internet of Vehicles. He has reported a security vulnerability of Tesla Model S, led a security research on the remote control of a BYD car, and participated in the drafting of security standards among the automobile society. Being a security expert employed by various information security organizations and companies, he is well experienced in security service, security evaluation, and penetration test.\n\nWenyuan Xu is a professor in the College of Electrical Engineering at Zhejiang University and an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of South Carolina. She received her Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Rutgers University in 2007. Her research interests include wireless security, network security, and IoT security.

Our current research using tools we previously released Badger at Black Hat in 2014 and the Kobra released at BsidesLV 2015 shows a 40 percent increase in outside unique IP traffic destinations and a 400 percent increase in data transmitted towards these destinations. But through the course of the research we found currently used IRP monitoring tools were lacking to help produce enough information to forensically investigate the exfiltration of user metadata. Pinworm is a sniffer that shows all created IRPs created in the kernel in I/O devices. The IRPs are correlated with the processes that created them and the called driver stack. With network traffic data we are off to the races. Using pinworm which we released this week, we will show forensic case studies from cradle to grave of what happens when you do things online in social media sites.\n\nLike all of our previously released tools, Pinworm is a framework including server side code you can use to collect and display user metadata inline in browser frames. Does this metadata collection happen in the browser, in userland, or in the kernel? Come to our talk and find out. We will demonstrate the collection of user metadata and collecting this information in a live browser session.

Trumbull Undergraduate CS Research Assistant, Utica College\n\nCloud service providers offer their customers the ability to deploy virtual machines in a multi-tenant environment. These virtual machines are typically connected to the physical network via a virtualized network configuration. This could be as simple as a bridged interface to each virtual machine or as complicated as a virtual switch providing more robust networking features such as VLANs, QoS, and monitoring. At DEF CON 23, we presented how attacks known to be successful on physical switches apply to their virtualized counterparts. Here, we present new results demonstrating successful attacks on more complicated virtual switch configurations such as VLANs. In particular, we demonstrate VLAN hopping, ARP poisoning and Man-in-the-Middle attacks across every major hypervisor platform. We have added more hypervisor environments and virtual switch configurations since our last disclosure, and have included results of attacks originating from the physical network as well as attacks originating in the virtual network.\n\nMr.Bull is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Utica College with a focus in computer networking and cybersecurity.

Surely our encrypted traffic is now safe on the local coffee shop network? If not, my VPN will definitely protect me... right? In this talk we'll reveal how recent improvements in online security and privacy can be undermined by decades old design flaws in obscure specifications. These design weakness can be exploited to intercept HTTPS URLs and proxy VPN tunneled traffic. We will demonstrate how a rogue access point or local network attacker can use these new techniques to bypass encryption, monitor your search history and take over your online accounts. No logos, no acronyms; this is not a theoretical crypto attack. We will show our techniques working on $30 hardware in under a minute. Online identity? Compromised. OAuth? Forget about it. Cloud file storage? Now we're talking.\n\nAlex Chapman is a Principal Security Researcher at Context Information Security in the UK, where he performs vulnerability discovery, exploit development, bespoke protocol analysis and reverse engineering. He has been credited in security advisories for a number of major software products for vendors such as Citrix, Google, Mozilla and VMware, and has presented his research at security conferences around the world. He has spent the past several months making things (for a change), poking holes in old technologies, and pointing out security flaws which have no place in modern day software.\n\nTwitter: @noxrnet\n\nPaul Stone is a Principal Security Researcher at Context Information Security in the UK where he performs vulnerability research, reverse engineering, and tool development.

However, Google is not alone in the struggle to keep Android safe. Qualcomm, a supplier of 80% of the chipsets in the Android ecosystem, has almost as much effect on Android’s security as Google. With this in mind, we decided to examine Qualcomm’s code in Android devices. During our research, we found multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities in multiple subsystems introduced by Qualcomm to all its Android devices in multiple different subsystems. In this presentation we will review not only the privilege escalation vulnerabilities we found, but also demonstrate and present a detailed exploitation, overcoming all the existing mitigations in Android’s Linux kernel to run kernel-code, elevating privileges and thus gaining root privileges and completely bypassing SELinux.\n\nAdam Donenfeld is a lead mobile security researcher at Check Point with vast experience in the mobile research field.

On that front, we argue that 6LoWPAN is a protocol that will be a dominant player as it is the only IoT-capable protocol that brings a full IP stack to the smallest devices. As evidence of this, we can highlight the fact that even the latest ZigBee Smart Energy standard is based on ZigBee IP which itself relies on 6LoWPAN, a competitor of the initial ZigBee protocol. Efficient IP-based penetration testing tools have been available to security auditors for years now. However, it is not that easy to use them in the context of a 6LoWPAN network since you need to be able to join it first. In fact, the difficult part is to associate with the underlying IEEE 802.15.4 infrastructure.\n\nIndeed, this standard already has two iterations since its release in 2003 and it provides with several possibilities regarding network topology, data transfer model and security suite. Unfortunately, there is no off-the-shelf component that provides, out of the box, with such a wide range of capabilities. Worst still, some of them deviate from the standard and can only communicate with components from the same manufacturer. In this paper, we present the ARSEN project: Advanced Routing for 6LoWPAN and Ethernet Networks. It provides security auditors with two new tools.\n\nFirst, a radio scanner capable of identifying IEEE 802.15.4 infrastructures and for each one of them their specificities, including several deviations from the standard that we encountered in actual security audits.\n\nSecondly, a border router capable of routing IPv6 datagrams between Ethernet and 6LoWPAN networks while adapting to the specificities identified by the scanner. As a result, the combination of both effectively allows security auditors to use available IP-based penetration testing tools on different 6LoWPAN networks.\n\nJonathan-Christofer Demay, PhD is the current penetration testing team leader at AIRBUS Defence and Space. As a former academic researcher, he has been working on IDS bypassing, intrusion detection and general network security. Now a consultant for various key industries and government bodies, he is working on incident response, penetration testing and social engineering. \n\nAdam Reziouk is an electronics and automation engineer currently working on wireless communications and industrial network security at AIRBUS Defence and Space. He holds a master's degree in electrical and electronic engineering and has been conducting vulnerability research activities on programmable logic controllers, connected devices and smart grids. \n\nArnaud Lebrun is a command and control engineer currently working at AIRBUS Defence and Space. He is focusing on security issues for several projects in the aerospace industry and related areas such as radioactive waste disposal facilities or large telescopes. He also supports the penetration testing team for perimeters that include ICS infrastructures or embedded electronics.",

And now we're weak, and the Machines know it. New D.C. is the last remaining human stronghold. Right now the Machines are preparing for one final assault that, if successful, will mean the end of all humanity. But it gets even worse. We've just received word that our leader, the Dark Tangent, has been captured. Without him we'll be unable to defend ourselves or mount a counter strike.\n\nYour mission is to lead a group of brave hackers to rescue the Dark Tangent. But before you can do that you'll need to work together to devise a secure messaging protocol that the Machines won't be able to break. This secure protocol is vital so that the troops can communicate in secret during the operation without the Machines figuring out what we're doing. It's all up to you now. Do you have what it takes to defeat the Machines? Will you save us all?\n\nThis is a completely different kind of workshop. I'll present a very specific infiltration scenario with attack vectors that we can expect the Machines to use, e.g. session hijacking, message poisoning, replay and MITM attacks, etc. As a group we'll then work through our mission objectives and design a messaging protocol that will allow us to communicate securely. Finally, we'll implement the protocol in C++ and use it to communicate with each other in real-time. If everything works as expected we'll be able to defeat the Machines and rescue the Dark Tangent. If not… then all of humanity is lost.\n\nPlease note that this is an intermediate-level, technical workshop and requires that attendees have a strong working knowledge of C/C++. Bring your laptop, a USB flash drive, and your favorite C/C++ 11 compiler (>= gcc/g++ 4.7 or msvc 2013).\n\nEijah is the founder of demonsaw, a secure and anonymous information sharing program.

The talk will specifically address static disassembly using IDA, looking at c compiled to x86_32, but the principles can be applied to any other language and assembly architecture. x86, is one of the most common assembly architectures, and incredibly useful for security engineers to understand. x86 is the assembly architecture running almost all Mac, Windows, and Linux computers.\n\nThe Dazzle Cat Duo are both security engineers who specialize in x86. In addition both serve as adjunct faculty members where they teach C and x86 .\n\nMax Class Size: 55\nPrerequisites for students: Students must have a basic coding knowledge, and understand what if/else/loops/switches logically do, in any coding language. \nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: Please bring a laptop with Virtual Box (latest version) and at least 20 gigs of free disk space. VM's with examples and tools will be distributed in class via USB sticks.",

Participants will be able to watch a demonstration on how to leverage insecurities in different protocols, and replicate the attacks themselves in a lab environment at the workshop. In addition, we will discuss what steps network engineers can do to limit the insecurities.\n\nThis workshop will contain network devices in which participants will be able to connect to and perform the demonstrated attacks. Participation will be reduced since network equipment resources are limited, unless additional lab equipment can be procured.\n\nThomas Wilhelm has been an associate professor at an NSACAE university, who has taught information assurance for many years at both the masters and undergraduate level. He has been a penetration tester and team lead for fortune 100 companies, and spent the last 20+ years involved in information security.\n\nThomas has written and authored numerous articles and books over the years on hacking; the latest is titled “Professional Penetration Testing (vol 2),” published by Syngress, which has been printed in multiple languages.

            "description": "C/C++ Boot Camp for Hackers\nEijah Founder, demonsaw\n\nThe C/C++ programming language is one of the most important programming languages ever created. Ever since Dennis Ritchie invented the language and Bjarne Stroustrup added object-oriented capabilities to it, C/C++ has been the standard by which all other languages are judged. C/C++ is considered the lingua franca of UNIX, Linux, BSD, and Windows as well as many software toolsets including GNU, Aircrack-ng, and the GCC compiler. And not only that, but C/C++ has influenced many other languages including C#, Java, Perl, PHP, and Python.\n\nAs hackers, we sometimes have to write code. And while there are more modern and higher-level languages available, C/C++ still plays a strong and prominent role in the hacking world due to its close ties to Linux and BSD. Whether we're writing shell scripts, python programs, PHP websites, contributing to a FOSS project, reverse engineering a binary, or rebuilding/patching the OS kernel; having a familiarity with C/C++ gives us a tremendous advantage and adds a powerful tool to our hacker arsenal.\n\nThis workshop is a C/C++ boot camp for hackers. It's an intense hands-on experience designed to get you up-to-speed with the most important parts of the C/C++ programming language using the GCC/G++ compiler. You'll learn about variables, functions, pointers, operators, classes, libraries, threads, templates, data structures, algorithms, exception handling, memory management, and design patterns. Whether you're a professional programmer, find yourself a little rusty and simply want a refresher course, or even if you'd never programmed in C/C++ before; this workshop is for you.\n\nPlease note that this is an intermediate-level, technical workshop and requires that attendees have prior experience in at least one programming language. Bring your laptop, a USB flash drive, and your favorite C/C++ 11 compiler (>= gcc/g++ 4.7 or msvc 2013).\n\nEijah is the founder of demonsaw, a secure and anonymous information sharing program. For the last 5 years he was also a Senior Programmer at Rockstar Games where he worked on Grand Theft Auto V for PS3, Xbox 360, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Eijah has over 15 years of software development and IT Security experience. His career has covered a broad range of Internet and mid-range technologies, core security, and system architecture. Eijah has been a faculty member at multiple colleges, has spoken about security and development at DEF CON and Hack Miami conferences, and holds a master’s degree in Computer Science. Eijah is an active member of the hacking community and is an avid proponent of Internet freedom.\n\nMax Class Size: 55\nPrerequisites for students: Previous experience in at least one programming language is required, although it doesn't have to be in C/C++.\nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: Laptop with Windows, Linux, or OSX.

Tools, tips and techniques will be shared to break out of restrictive execution environments and escalate privileges from low level user to SYSTEM on modern Windows operating systems. Contrary to common perception, Windows machines can be really well locked down if they are configured with care. As such attackers will need to dig deep in order to break out of restrictive environments and escalate privileges.\n\nThe breakout portion of the workshop will cover fundamental techniques required to get a shell on applications which are deployed through Terminal Services and Citrix or in environments which have been locked down through Software Restriction Policies (SRPs) and Group Policy. Topics covered will include:\n\nAbusing intended application functionality\nBypassing folder path / type restrictions\nFile protocol handlers\nEvading black / white lists.\nThe Windows privilege escalation portion of the workshop aims to provide attendees with a solid understanding of the various steps required to escalate privileges from low level users to SYSTEM level privileges. Automated tools, such as meterpreter's \"getsystem\", have their place in this process however reliance on automation breeds weakness. Topics covered will include:\n\nEnumeration of the target machine\nIdentification of common and uncommon configuration weaknesses\nPermission analysis\nAnalysis of Windows privilege escalation vulnerabilities\nBoth portions of the workshop will have real-world examples that attendees can get their hands dirty with in order to solidify the theory. This workshop aims to provide hands-on knowledge which can be directly applied against locked down environments in the field. After taking this workshop you should always hide your smile when someone brags there is no way to compromise their locked down system!\n\nMy name is Ruben Boonen (sometimes known as b33f). I have been working in InfoSec since 2012, one year as part of the Offensive Security team, assisting students from around the world as they worked through Offsec's various certifications and a further three years as a security consultant. I have a well-rounded skill set, having taken on many web application, infrastructure and bespoke engagements. I have, however, developed a special interest for Windows exploitation: Domain hacking, exploit development, client-side attacks, restricted environments, privilege escalation, persistence and post-exploitation.\n\nNot only do I enjoy breaking things but I also take great pleasure in helping others understand and replicate the attackers methodology. I was previously an assistant trainer for Offensive Security's Advanced Windows Exploitation course at Black Hat. Since 2011 I have also been maintaining an InfoSec blog to share interesting research with a wider audience.\n\nMy name is Francesco Mifsud. I'm relatively new to the InfoSec Industry but I've spent my fair share of sleepless nights staring at debuggers and ASM. I've been working at Context Information Security for the past couple of years as a security consultant: Web applications, infrastructure jobs, mobile engagements, anything the company throws at me.\n\nDuring my research on exploit-development I have realized that a lot of material is out there on how to get a shell on the box, but not much on how to proceed afterwards. What happens if you don't get Admin or Root? If the obtained shell is severely restricted can you really say you have successfully compromised a machine? Due to this, I have developed an interest in post-exploitation, namely Breakouts and Privilege Escalation. I have come a long way since then (or that's what I like to believe) and now it's time to pass this knowledge on to others!\n\nMax Class Size: 55\nPrerequisites for students: There are no special requirements to attend the workshop, everyone is welcome and can benefit from the theoretical parts covered in each section. \nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: To participate in the hands-on portions, attendees will need to bring a laptop with 1GB RAM (2GB recommended) which can be dedicated to a Virtual Machine, both WMWare Player and VirtualBox can be downloaded for free.\n\nWe strongly recommend attendees download a free \"Windows 10\" evaluation version and bring it with them to the workshop.

Since osquery allows us to easily ask questions about our infrastructure, it provides powerful capabilities, such as finding malware persistence techniques and scanning IOCs across our fleets of machines. This workshop is a very hands-on training and we expect participants to be comfortable with CLI. The workshop is broken into three components:\n\nPart I - hunting malware with osquery (1.5 hours) The first section of the workshop will make use of the interactive osquery command line tool (osqueryi) to hunt for characteristics of malware residing on a local system. The goal of this section is to get students familiar with writing SQL statements and to understand how osquery makes use of core tables to abstract operating system artifacts.\n\nPart II - osquery at scale (1.5 hours): The second part of the workshop will focus on automation and deployment of osquery at a larger scale. You will learn how to write “query packs” which are utilized to collect and analyze the results from various endpoints in an enterprise. We will demonstrate this concept with the use of virtual machines, however the methodologies can be extrapolated to larger enterprises.\n\nPart III - osquery development (optional - 0.5 to 1 hours): The last part of the workshop focuses on osquery development. We will walk you through some of the core components of osquery so you can have a deeper understand of this application. The goal being to give the student sufficient information to hack on the osquery project. This segment is largely optional and designed for people who want to get familiar with how osquery works under the hood.\n\nWho should attend? \nThis workshop is designed for information security professionals who defend small to large scale enterprise networks.\n\nWhat you need to know?\n\nLinux/MAC operating systems and CLI environments\nComfortable writing and operating in SQLite What would be helpful to know?\nKnowledge of ELK stack or splunk deployment/functionality is helpful\nSome programming experience is helpful\nGeneral knowledge of malware TTP is helpful What do you need to bring?\nA laptop capable of running two virtual machines (2 cores +, 8GB RAM, and 40GB Free disk space)\nPre-installed VMWare client\nSereyvathana Ty is a member of Detection Infrastructure at Facebook working on network security monitoring instrumentations.

            "description": "Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Evasion Techniques\nThomas Wilhelm\n\nJohn Spearing Co-founder and Operations Manager, Crystal Defense Network Information Security\n\nIn most professional penetration tests, the pentester is given unrestricted, unfettered access to a network. However, this does not provide an effective evaluation of all preventative measures available to an organization that prevent and identify ongoing attacks. As a result, more businesses now require pentesters to confront Intrusion Detection / Prevention Systems aimed at limiting attacks in their network. The ability to understand how IDS/IPS systems work and effective techniques to circumvent their efforts to restrict your activities within the network is becoming essential for pentesters.\n\nIn this workshop, we will build an IPS system and examine their inherent limitations. We will then perform attacks within a test lab environment to see how effective the IPS is against our typical attacks. Once we understand how IPS systems limit our ability to pentest, we will then look at ways to exploit IPS limitations to be more effective in our professional penetration tests.\n\nThomas Wilhelm has been an associate professor at an NSACAE university, who has taught information assurance for many years at both the masters and undergraduate level. He has been a penetration tester and team lead for fortune 100 companies, and spent the last 20+ years involved in information security.\n\nThomas has written and authored numerous articles and books over the years on hacking; the latest is titled “Professional Penetration Testing (vol 2),” published by Syngress, which has been printed in multiple languages. Thomas holds two masters degrees (MSCS, MSM) and maintains the following certifications: ISSMP, CISSP, CCNP Security, SCSECA, SCNA, SCSA, IEM, IAM.\n\nJohn Spearing works in the field of network and physical security, and has obtained a Masters Degree in both Computer Science and Organizational Behavior. John is the co-founder and Operations Manager of the MSSP company known as Crystal Defense Network Information Security, located in central Colorado. John's specialty within the Information Security realm is centralized around network intrusion detection and prevention, as well as endpoint security.\n\nMax Class Size: 55\nPrerequisites for students: Students should already be familiar with penetration testing techniques and tools (and their flags). The use of proxies will be required to participate, so knowledge of how to configure your hacking platform to intercept and ability to modify packets is essential.\nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: Since this is an advanced penetration testing subject, participants should have a laptop with the ability to host virtual images, which also contains an up to date Kali Linux image. In addition, if they want to participate in actual attacks within the lab, they should bring CAT5 cables for connectivity. This class will not spend time getting students online - participants should already be familiar with configuring static IP addresses and/or DHCP for their systems. Because participants will be able to connect to a lab environment with active exploits, it is suggested that students use a computer system that can be easily re-imaged at the end of the workshop.",

A malware analysis lab can be thought of as a set of entry points into a tool chain. The main entry points are a file, a URL, a network traffic capture, and a memory image. This talk is an examination of the major open source tools that satisfy the analysis requirements for each of these entry points. Each tool’s output can potentially feed into another tool for further analysis. The linking of one tool to the next in a tool chain allows one to build a comprehensive automated malware analysis lab using open source software.\n\nFor file analysis, the three major versions of Cuckoo Sandbox will be examined. To analyze a potentially malicious URL, the low-interaction honeyclient, Thug, will be covered. Next, if one has a network capture (PCAP) to analyze, the Bro Network Security Monitor is a great option, and will be covered. Finally, if the analysis target is a memory image, the Volatility Framework will be examined. Each of the inputs and outputs of the tools will be reviewed to expose ways that they can be chained together for the purpose of automation. For each tool covered, the class will login to live instances of each and learn the basics of malware analysis using each one.\n\nRobert Simmons is the Director of Research Innovation at ThreatConnect, Inc. With an expertise in building automated malware analysis systems based on open source tools, he has been tracking malware and phishing attacks and picking them apart for years. Robert is also the author of PlagueScanner, an open source virus scanner framework.\n\nRobert, also known as Utkonos, has a background in biology, linguistics, and Russian area studies. He has lived extensively in Russia and Ukraine and has been known to swear profusely and constantly in Russian.\n\nMax Class Size: 55\nPrerequisites for students: None\nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: Bring a laptop with the current version of Chrome installed and a tested and working network connection (provide your own internet, please - only rely on the conference network if absolutely needed). Everything is remote and connected to via web browser - no malware will be worked on your equipment. Everything is remote.",

They can be deployed as protection mechanisms for an organization’s real systems, or as research units to study and analyze the methods employed by human hackers or malware. In this workshop we will outline the operation of two research honeypots, by manual deployment and testing in real time. A honeypot system will undertake the role of a web trap for attackers who target the SSH service in order to gain illegal server access. Another one will undertake the role of a malware collector, usually deployed by malware analysts and anti-virus companies to gather and securely store malicious binary samples. We will also talk about post-capturing activities and further analysis techniques. As an example, we will see how to index all the captured information in a search engine like Elasticsearch and then utilize ElastAlert, an easy to use framework to setup meaningful alerting. Lastly, visualization tools will be presented for the aforementioned systems, plus a honeypot bundle Linux distribution that contains pre-configured versions of the above tools and much more related utilities, which can make the deployment of honeypots in small or large networks an easy task.\n\nIoannis is an Information Security engineer and researcher, working to protect company assets, data and operations. His general interests are programming, security, development operations (DevOps) and cloud computing while his academic interests include honeypots, honeyclients, botnet tracking, malware analysis, intrusion detection and security visualization. Ioannis has released a number of utilities to aid information security professionals using honeypots. Some of them are Kippo-Graph, Honeyd-Viz and HoneyDrive; a self-contained honeypot bundle Linux distribution. These tools are used by numerous university researchers, various CERT teams worldwide and have also been included in the “Proactive detection of security incidents II – Honeypots” report by ENISA (European Union Agency for Network and Information Security).\n\nMax Class Size: 55\nPrerequisites for students: Setup of VirtualBox for their OS\nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: Only their laptops.",

If you work in cloud, or are just cloud-curious, we’ll get you up to speed on the latest and greatest practical techniques for securing Amazon Web Services. We are cutting out all the theory to focus exclusively on the technical implementation.\n\nBefore coming to the session you should know what AWS is and be able to launch and connect to an instance (we’ll provide instructions ahead of time just to be safe). You should also be comfortable with a Linux command line and basic scripting. That’s all you need walking in, but by the time you leave we will have shown you:\n\nHow to build complex AWS virtual networks with cross-account and VPC connectivity.\nHow to leverage auto scale groups for building immutable infrastructure. What’s that? Servers that are impossible to log into and replaced every few hours with 0 downtime.\nTechniques for advanced IAM policies in AWS. For example, using tags or other conditionals for dynamic, fine-grained access.\nBuilding server less infrastructure for automating security. You can, and we sh*t you not, create actual self-healing infrastructure in AWS without any running servers.\nAutomation techniques to play with the AWS APIs like a boss. Sure, we’ll focus on the defensive side, but let’s just say you offensive types might pick up a thing or two.\nHow to build an automated deployment pipeline using Git, Jenkins, Packer, and Ansible to push new images to AWS. (We’ll use a scripted build for time, but you’ll see how it all pieces together).\nIf we have time, we’ll show you how t use Amazon’s Key Management Service to encrypt… everything. Plus cover how to make things subpoena proof, if you are into that sort of thing.\nThe focus of the workshop is on defense, and how to best use the tools in AWS for security. We can’t cover anything in four hours, so we will focus on the technical techniques you can use to most-quickly build up your skills. \n\nRich has twenty years experience in information security, physical security, and risk management.

When an attacker is able to find and exploit such a vulnerability, the end result is often disastrous: complete database downloaded, application backdoor created or even remote code execution. Suffice to say that penetration testers need to find these vulnerabilities before the bad guys do.\n\nBut vulnerability scanners and automated exploitation tools like sqlmap can only do so much when it comes to finding and exploiting SQLi vulnerabilities. While they do a good job for regular or error-based SQLi vulnerabilities, their success rate lowers drastically when blind SQLi is encountered, especially when time-based attacks are required. And if you need to be quiet on the network, most tools are just insanely noisy…\n\nThis course is designed to help penetration testers who have been using these tools to get to the next level, where finding and exploiting SQLi is no longer easy.

Can you create a program that can take any arbitrary program as an input and certify it as free from such errors or alert you of possible avenues of errors? Is such a thing even possible? Turns out, yes you can, or at least after this training you will be able to.\n\nRecent advances in the field of formal program analysis have led to development of theories and tools that can, given a program as input, either guarantee absence of certain types of errors or raise alarms to alert of possible weaknesses in the given program. Sounds like black magic? The goal of this training is to de-mystify the science behind automated program analysis and build a solid foundation for attendees to start building their own tools that can automatically analyze and certify code correctness.\n\nThe workshop will cover the challenges in automated program analysis, what is possible and what is not possible, and why. We will focus on using Abstract Interpretation, a widely used formal framework, for describing sound by construction program analysis algorithms as approximations of semantics of the language. Finally, in the hands-on session, we will build our own code analyzer for a simple language that can analyze any program written in that language and issue certificates of correctness.\n\nVivek Notani is a PhD student at University of Verona, under Dr. Roberto Giacobazzi. Previously, Vivek used to work as a research scholar at University of Louisiana at Lafayette (USA) focusing on dynamic methods of malware analysis and machine learning applications to malware analysis and reverse engineering. His research at UL Lafayette led to the creation of Virusbattle, an automated malware analysis system that harvests intelligence from large malware repositories which was presented at BlackHat last year. VirusBattle has since been commercialized by Cythereal LLC. USA. Early on in his career, Vivek used to work in humanoid robotics and helped create Acyut, series of India's first indigenously developed humanoid robot which created a world record in humanoid weightlifting at FIRA-2010.\n\nRoberto Giacobazzi is a senior professor of computer science at University of Verona and the Scientific Leader of the SPY-Lab. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 1993 from the University of Pisa. From 1993 to 1995 he had a Post Doctoral Research position at Laboratoire d'Informatique (LIX), Ecole Polytechnique (Paris) in the equipe Cousot, the creator of the theory of Abstract Interpretation. His research interests include abstract interpretation, static program analysis, semantics of programming languages, program verification, abstract model-checking, program transformation and optimization, digital asset protection, code obfuscation, software watermarking and lattice theory. He is author of more than 100 publications in international journals and conferences and he is involved in national (italian) and international (european) research projects in the field of static program analysis. His main current research interest is in formal methods for systematic design of domains and transfer functions or abstract interpretation, with application in security, digital asset protection, code obfuscation, watermarking, malware analysis, semantics, program analysis, and abstract model-checking. In the past, he gave a declarative semantics for Prolog control features and he studied new methodologies to design static program analyzers and optimization techniques for logic and constraint-based languages by abstract interpretation. In lattice theory he contributed to understanding of the structure of the lattice of closure operators and complete congruence relations on complete lattices. He is in the Steering Committee of the Static Analysis Symposium and of the ACM Conference on Principles of Programming Languages, POPL.

One of the main waves in cyber security promising to enable that ability is cyber deception, a field that has garnered much attention and investments in the last couple of years. Based on the same concepts as honeypots, but on a different technology, cyber deception promises to create decoys and other assets to make attackers expose themselves and allow it's users to not only detect them, but collect forensics that can be used for immediate mitigation.\n\nDuring this workshop, attendees will learn about MazeRunner, Cymmetria's cyber deception solution which is being released for the first time as the first cyber deception free general use tool. Along with it they will be able to set up deception across environments that will be composed of decoys - real virtual machines that can be linux/windows systems. Configure these machines with different network protocols and content to make them look like anything to deceive a hacker, and lastly creating the connections and credentials to these configurations to deploy to the endpoints, thereby creating a complete layer of deception to lead an attacker. Next we will show how to use the alerts and forensics gathered in order to enable automatic mitigation of threats and enrich your threat intel efforts.\n\nDean Sysman is CTO and co-founder of Cymmetria, an Israeli cyber deception start-up. A unit 8200 veteran, Dean started his military intelligence career first as a low-level security researcher, later on promoted to the rank of Captain to lead high level security research, earning multiple awards for his service.

            "description": "Brainwashing Embedded Systems\nCraig Young Security Researcher, Tripwire\n\nLearning the secret incantations to make embedded systems carry out your will is not as hard as one might think. In the world of IoT, the hardened system is rare and most times a firmware image is more than enough to find and exploit weakness. This session explains in detail a process for going from zero-knowledge to zero-day on real-world devices without breaking a sweat. Attendees to this tutorial session will learn the ropes of firmware dissection, app decompilation, and manual fuzz testing in a hands-on hack lab. Participants will be provided with a customized Kali Linux virtual appliance and given access to several consumer devices for analysis. These techniques have been successfully employed by the author to identify over 100 CVEs on embedded/IoT devices as well as to win the 0-day and CTF tracks in the DEF CON 22 SOHOpelessly Broken router hacking competition.\n\nCraig Young is a computer security researcher with Tripwire's Vulnerability and Exposures Research Team (VERT). He has identified and responsibly disclosed dozens of vulnerabilities in products from Google, Amazon, IBM, NETGEAR, Adobe, HP, Apple, and others. His research has resulted in numerous CVE assignments and repeated recognition in the Google Application Security Hall of Fame. Craig's presentations on Google authentication weaknesses have led to considerable security improvements for all Google users. Craig won in track 0 and track 1 of the first ever SOHOpelessly Broken contest at DEF CON 22 by demonstrating 10 0-day flaws in SOHO wireless routers. His research into iOS WiFi problems more recently exposed CVE-2015-3728 that could allow devices to inadvertently connect to malicious hot spots. Craig has more recently turned his attention to a different part of the wireless spectrum with research into home automation products as well as RFID/NFC technology.\n\nMax Class Size: 55\nPrerequisites for students: Basic *nix knowledge; comfort with a shell; understanding of HTTP\nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: If you need to collect a fee for materials, list them in your application, you will need to provide a list so attendees can purchase materials themselves in advance.\n\nNothing is required but in order to make the most out of the workshop, students will want to have a laptop with an 802.11 adapter and virtualization software capable of running an x86_64 virtual machine from an OVA/OVF (e.g. VirtualBox or VMWare). Virtual machine files will be made available on USB so an open USB port is preferred.",

Having to crunch through all the logs that the various devices (firewalls, routers, security appliances etc.) spit out, correlating that data and in real time making the right choices can prove to be a nightmare. Even with the solutions already available in the market.\n\nAs I have experienced this myself, as part of the Internal DevOps and Incident Response Teams, in several cases, I would want to create a space for interested folks to design, build, customize and deploy their very own FOSS based centralized visual attack monitoring dashboard. This setup would be able to perform real time analysis using the trusted ELK stack and visually denote what popular attack hotspots exist on a network.\n\nMadhu Akula is an Automation Security Ninja at Appsecco, a company that specializes in Web Application Security.

Can you create a program that can take any arbitrary program as an input and certify it as free from such errors or alert you of possible avenues of errors? Is such a thing even possible? Turns out, yes you can, or at least after this training you will be able to.\n\nRecent advances in the field of formal program analysis have led to development of theories and tools that can, given a program as input, either guarantee absence of certain types of errors or raise alarms to alert of possible weaknesses in the given program. Sounds like black magic? The goal of this training is to de-mystify the science behind automated program analysis and build a solid foundation for attendees to start building their own tools that can automatically analyze and certify code correctness.\n\nThe workshop will cover the challenges in automated program analysis, what is possible and what is not possible, and why. We will focus on using Abstract Interpretation, a widely used formal framework, for describing sound by construction program analysis algorithms as approximations of semantics of the language. Finally, in the hands-on session, we will build our own code analyzer for a simple language that can analyze any program written in that language and issue certificates of correctness.\n\nVivek Notani is a PhD student at University of Verona, under Dr. Roberto Giacobazzi. Previously, Vivek used to work as a research scholar at University of Louisiana at Lafayette (USA) focusing on dynamic methods of malware analysis and machine learning applications to malware analysis and reverse engineering. His research at UL Lafayette led to the creation of Virusbattle, an automated malware analysis system that harvests intelligence from large malware repositories which was presented at BlackHat last year. VirusBattle has since been commercialized by Cythereal LLC. USA. Early on in his career, Vivek used to work in humanoid robotics and helped create Acyut, series of India's first indigenously developed humanoid robot which created a world record in humanoid weightlifting at FIRA-2010.\n\nRoberto Giacobazzi is a senior professor of computer science at University of Verona and the Scientific Leader of the SPY-Lab. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 1993 from the University of Pisa. From 1993 to 1995 he had a Post Doctoral Research position at Laboratoire d'Informatique (LIX), Ecole Polytechnique (Paris) in the equipe Cousot, the creator of the theory of Abstract Interpretation. His research interests include abstract interpretation, static program analysis, semantics of programming languages, program verification, abstract model-checking, program transformation and optimization, digital asset protection, code obfuscation, software watermarking and lattice theory. He is author of more than 100 publications in international journals and conferences and he is involved in national (italian) and international (european) research projects in the field of static program analysis. His main current research interest is in formal methods for systematic design of domains and transfer functions or abstract interpretation, with application in security, digital asset protection, code obfuscation, watermarking, malware analysis, semantics, program analysis, and abstract model-checking. In the past, he gave a declarative semantics for Prolog control features and he studied new methodologies to design static program analyzers and optimization techniques for logic and constraint-based languages by abstract interpretation. In lattice theory he contributed to understanding of the structure of the lattice of closure operators and complete congruence relations on complete lattices. He is in the Steering Committee of the Static Analysis Symposium and of the ACM Conference on Principles of Programming Languages, POPL. Dr. Giacobazzi's research in abstract interpretation led to the creation of Julia in 2006, which has since been acquired by the Corvallis Group,a leading firm in software development and assurance in the banking market.\n\nMax Class Size: 55\nPrerequisites for students:\n\nProgramming background in C++\nUnderstanding of Software development and testing methods\nBasic understanding of these theories will be helpful but is not required: static analysis, dynamic analysis, lattice theory, FixPoint Theory and, abstract interpretation.\nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: Laptop with Linux.

In this course, instead of taking the regular flaws in crypto-implementations or popular attacks from past, we will take a holistic approach. Build strong understanding of the crypto-subsystems, their inherent security issues and how to discover, exploit and remediate them all in Flat-4-Hours.\n\nThis workshop takes the participants to next level of practical crypto-assessment and exploitation. With deeper understanding of crypto-systems, plenty of hands on vulnerability assessments and exploitation using Openssl and Open source tools and my custom scripts, participants will learn the important concepts which they can apply in real world RedTeam Pentesting or BlueTeam Defending, assessments & audits of crypto implementations.\n\nThe workshop starts with a dive into the crypto systems present on participant’s own (virtual) machine. Taking a bottom up approach, we start form of Hardware Modules, Firmware, Crypto-Libraries, Network services & we will go all the way up to applications, trust/key stores, understanding the role of each layer in cryptography, test for quality + vulnerabilities and exploit them.\n\nSome of the unique modules covered in the workshop are testing the quality of numbers generated from RNGs & PRNGs from various sources, Extracting prime numbers from the Private keys, DH parameters, Secrete keys and testing for backdoors (Number Fixation), quality of randomness, Safety parameters (like Sofie German Test). And as we go upwards we will search and steal the insecure keys for network hopping like APT/malwares, pin rogue certificates, bypass HSTS checks to steal cookies, exploit certificate switching, Look for Seeds used in PRNG functions, re-usage of keys and flaws in SCEP implementations. And we top it up with the popular named Attacks from HEARTBLEED to LOGJAM and other popular CVEs.\n\nI will be sharing numerous scripts written by me and open source tools which participants can use to test or automate the assessment of their own crypto-systems.\n\nWorkshop is best suited for pen-testers, developers, security engineers, auditors, compliance consultants in general but a must for those who deal with products or services involving cryptography and PKI implementations. The contents + flow of the workshop is well structured to accommodate participants from beginner to advanced level of competence.\n\nAjit is a founder of \"SECURITY MONX\" & author of LAMMA project, an Open Source Initiative to - improve security of Crypto Implementations & - better consume Cyber Threat Intelligence, which also is his primary area of research.\n\nCurrently Ajit is Principle consultant (Cryptography & System Security) with Payatu Technologies. He has worked as a Security Researcher with Symantec, Emerson, IBM, Bluelane Technologies in past & has presented his research at BlackHat, Defcon-CnPV & Nullcon.\n\nAjit is also a co-founder of \"null Open Security Community\", a hardcore volunteer and contributor through the community efforts of Null, Nullcon, SecurityTube.net & BSidesLV.

What about that idea for an awesome hacking tool you imagined but didn't know how to build? If the massive learning curve to hardware design is holding back your plans to hack the world, then this is the workshop for you!\n\nIn this workshop, you will design your own basic LAN tap (based on the throwing star LAN tap from Great Scott Gadgets). We will go from the very basics all the way to a full set of design documentation that you could use to get your hardware design mass produced.\n\nSeth Wahle is an electronics engineer and hardware hacker. He was featured in Forbes and BBC for hacking android phones using an implanted NFC chip in 2015. Seth has developed hardware that allows for 4k streaming video, produced a device that detects and eliminates enemy I.E.D.’s, and developed radio communications equipment for the next generation of fighter jets. Now as the lead engineer for Cyberdonix, Seth is developing next-gen I.O.T. based security appliances.\n\nMax Class Size: 55\nPrerequisites for students: None\nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate:\n\nComputer running Linux, OSX, or Windows with EagleCAD (freeware version is fine) installed.

            "description": "Physical Security for Computing Systems, a Look at Design, Attacks and Defenses\nSteve Weingart Security Researcher\n\nPhysical security for computing systems is a topic that usually gets left to FIPS 140 and tamper labels, but it is a much broader and more interesting subject. As the value of data on computing systems increases and operating systems become more secure, physical attacks on computing systems to steal or modify assets become more likely. At the low end are locks and tamper labels, at the high end are complex mechanisms to detect and respond to tampering and intrusion from the box level all the way down to the chip level. All of this technology requires constant review and improvement, just as other competitive technologies need review to stay at the leading edge. The bar is ever rising.\n\nPhysical security is an interdisciplinary field. The materials and chemistry are as important as the electronics, circuits and physics. A tamper label can be defeated by application of the right solvent. A cover switch can be defeated by piping super glue in through an air vent or a slightly bent cover. Hard epoxies can be removed with drain cleaner and a tamper detection circuit can be defeated by setting the supply voltage to a critical value or a microprocessor's start up tests bypassed by manipulating the width of the reset pulse.\n\nThis training session will show many of the known attack and defense methods from the basic to the exotic. It will include easy and low tech ways of performing high tech attacks, as well as descriptions of the highest tech methods.\n\nDesign examples will be shown with examples of the tools, devices, circuits and materials used to implement both attack and defense systems. Demonstrations will be included.\n\nSteve Weingart has been active in the Security Standards and Physical Security communities since the 1980's. He was on the NIST panel that wrote FIPS 140-1 and has been a continuing contributor to both FIPS 140 and Common Criteria development. At the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, he was the lead engineer for the IBM 4758 secure coprocessor which was the first cryptographic module validated at Security Level 4 under FIPS 140-1. He has continued to work in the security field as a developer of secure cryptographic modules, a consultant, a standards test lab engineer and as a standards test lab manager. Steve now coordinates security standard certifications for Aruba and continues to consult, contribute to the standards community and trains others in security standards and physical security.\n\nMax Class Size: 55\nPrerequisites for students: Some knowledge of analog and digital electronic circuits would be very helpful. Knowledge of materials and some chemistry is handy too.\nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: None, I will supply any needed.",
