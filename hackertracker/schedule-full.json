When it comes to network design of a large-scale network through security random decisions or decisions based on “trends”, “it works for every case”‘s or “hunches” are bad decisions for sure. Security research teams and purple security teams are in charge of a very important job, running the actual research on what’s happening on the network before designing a custom security strategy for its defense: from network flow modeling, pentest coordination and malware analysis to custom tools development security research teams are pushing the “purple team” concept to the next step.\n\nAs the chief of security research of a data center with more than 3K servers including virtualized services, dedicated servers and clusters administrated by different clients I was in charge of designing the security strategy of the network. In this talk I will explain the process that me and my team of 7 security engineers followed to perform that task focusing on the tools and methodologies we developed during the process.\n\nDuring that process we developed a couple of custom tools: One for doing automatic incident report and response between clients and the main company using SmartContracts and other for detecting anomalies on the network flow based on mathematical methods. We want to release these tools as free-software during the conference :)",

Scanners only scratch the surface or your application. Yet, many companies already have a large set of integration tests that snake their way deeply into the application, covering nearly every workflow. In this talk, we will use a minimal amount of work to transform these integration tests into a suite of security tests.\nUsing Selenium, ZAP, Syntribos, and PostMan, we will repurpose integration tests into security tests to search for common web application flaws such as XSS, XXE, and SQLi with more context than a scanner. These security tests will traverse the web application the same way a real user would. We will then extend these tests to find subtle security bugs in authorization, authentication, and business logic.\nThis session is ideal for security professionals and testers interested in making security testing part of their continuous integration pipeline.",

			"description": "The MD5 hashing algorithm is cryptographically broken and it has been over 10 years since the first practical collision was demonstrated. Despite this, the algorithm is still widely used for sharing indicators of compromise amongst security vendors as well as in file repositories and file reputation software. We will present the practical implementation of a novel attack that uses a specifically crafted collision to leave both researchers and security products that rely on MD5 exposed to the actual threat.\nBuilding on previously documented chosen-prefix attacks against MD5 we developed a variant for Windows executable files which allows generating collisions between digitally signed executables and chosen malware. This technique leaves the Authenticode signature completely intact, thus potentially creating identity confusion between a binary signed by a trusted provider such as Google, Adobe, Apple, etc. and a malicious file.\nThe resulting pair of files can then be used to thwart file reputation systems that rely on MD5 hashes. We will show the real-world impact of the technique during a demonstration bypassing an endpoint security solution by exploiting the MD5 collision and implicit trust of signed binaries to “whitelist” a malware of our choice.",

			"description": "In this presentation we will introduce a new feature to eaphammer: the ability to easily and reliably perform rogue AP attacks against 802.11n/802.11ac networks that operate on the 5Ghz spectrum. Although most hostapd-based tools for performing rogue AP attacks do support the creation of 5Ghz 802.11n/802.11ac access points, we are the first tool to do so reliably and without extensive manual configuration.\n\nThe 5Ghz spectrum has presented a challenge to wireless penetration testers since its inception due to hardware compatibility issues. This challenge is further compounded by the widespread adoption of 802.11n and 802.11ac, both of which are comprised largely of edge cases that can be tedious to implement in software.\n\nIn this presentation we will address both of these issues. We will address the hardware issues by performing a side-by-side comparison of multiple 802.11n/802.11ac wireless adapters to identify models that perform well within a penetration testing environment. We will then introduce a set of unified configs that can be used to reliably create rogue access points using each of these models, and demonstrate how they have been implemented in eaphammer.",

During the first part of this talk, we’ll discuss how to leverage the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) to perform these client-side attacks, as well as how to evade defensive capabilities and avoid detection.\n\nOne of the challenges faced by defenders is mitigating these threats without making the browser unusable. Users constrained by security policies will inevitably find a way around those policies. An effective defender must work to reduce risk without affecting functionality, using the tools already at their disposal. This includes browser management through Group Policy, attack signatures in order to filter or drop traffic, and other compensating controls. During the second half of this talk, we will cover the three major browsers, while discussing which provides the most discrete levels of control and protection for the user.",

			"description": "This workshop will instruct attendees on how to carry out sophisticated wireless attacks against corporate infrastructure. Attendees will learn how to attack and gain access to WPA2-Enterprise networks, bypass network access controls, and perform replay attacks to gain administrative control over an Active Directory environment. External wireless adapters and preconfigured live USBs will be provided to all workshop attendees, and material learned in the lectures will be practiced within a realistic lab environment.\n\nAreas of focus include:\n\n- Wireless reconnaissance and target identification within a red team environment\n- Attacking and gaining entry to WPA2-EAP wireless networks\n- LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning\n- Firewall and NAC Evasion Using Indirect Wireless Pivots\n- MITM and SMB Relay Attacks\n- Downgrading modern SSL/TLS implementations using partial HSTS bypasses\n\nPREREQUISITES:\nDownload Virtual Lab and Course Guide before class\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwFgM9oAhmd_c2JJaG1iUmhkZTg",
