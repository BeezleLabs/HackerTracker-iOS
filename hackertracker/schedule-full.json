   "description" : "Most people lock their doors at night, however if you walk  into someone's home you likely won't find every piece of furniture bolted to  the floor as well. We trust that if someone is inside our home they are  supposed to be there. Unfortunately many developers treat local networks just  the same, assuming all internal HTTP traffic is trusted, however this is not  always the case. They incorrectly assume that their services will be  protected by the same-origin policy in browsers, rather than implementing proper  authentication mechanisms. By abusing this implicit trust we can gain access  to confidential data and internal services which are not intended to be  publicly accessible.     I will demonstrate that this is a poor security control and can be  trivially bypassed via an older technique, DNS rebinding. The talk will cover  how DNS rebinding works, the mitigations imposed by modern browsers and  networks, and how each mitigation can be bypassed. I will discuss the  notorious unreliability of DNS rebinding attacks that causes many developers  to ignore the issue and how to overcome this unreliability.     Finally, I will examine a variety of popular services and tools to  understand how they are affected by DNS rebinding. I will be releasing a tool  that allows researchers to automate DNS rebinding attacks, the associated  mitigation bypasses and generate drop-dead simple proof-of-concept exploits.  I will demonstrate this tool by developing exploits for each vulnerable  service, ending the talk by exploiting a vulnerable service to obtain  remote-code execution, live.",

   "description" : "Ethereum is gaining a significant popularity in the blockchain  community, mainly due to fact that it is design in a way that enables  developers to write decentralized applications (Dapps) and smart-contract  using blockchain technology.    Ethereum blockchain is a  consensus-based globally executed virtual machine, also referred as Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) by  implemented its own micro-kernel supporting a handful number of instructions,  its own stack, memory and storage. This enables the radical new concept of  distributed applications.    Contracts live on the blockchain in an Ethereum-specific binary format (EVM  bytecode). However, contracts are typically written in some high-level  language such as Solidity and then compiled into byte code to be uploaded on  the blockchain. Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language whose  syntax is similar to that of JavaScript.  This new paradigm of applications opens the door to many possibilities  and opportunities. Blockchain is often referred as secure by design, but now  that blockchains can embed applications this raise multiple questions  regarding architecture, design, attack vectors and patch deployments.    As we, reverse engineers,  know having access to source code is often a luxury. Hence, the need for an  open-source tool like Porosity: decompiler for EVM bytecode into readable  Solidity-syntax contracts - to enable static and dynamic analysis of compiled  contracts.",

This June, at  Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference, Apple announced that their watch is  not only the #1 selling smartwatch worldwide by far, but also announced the  introduction of new capabilities that will come with the release of watchOS  4. Like other devices, Apple Watch contains highly sensitive user data such  as email and text messages, contacts, GPS and more, and like other devices  and operating systems, has become a target for malicious activity.    This talk will provide an overview of Apple Watch and watchOS security  mechanisms including codesign enforcement, sandboxing, memory protections and  more. We will cover vulnerabilities and exploitation details and dive into  the techniques used in creating an Apple Watch jailbreak. This will  ultimately lead to a demonstration and explanation of jailbreaking an Apple  Watch, showcasing how it can access important user data and applications.",

   "description" : "CSRF remains an elusive problem due to legacy code, legacy  frameworks, and developers not understanding the problem or how to protect  against it. Wiping out CSRF introduces primitives and strategies for building  solutions to CSRF that can be bolted on to any http application where http  requests and responses can be intercepted, inspected, and modified. Modern  frameworks have done a great job at providing solutions to the CSRF problem  that automatically integrate into the application and solve most of the  conditions. However, many existing apps and new apps that don't take  advantage of these frameworks or use them incorrectly are still plagued with  this problem. Wiping out CSRF will provide an in depth overview of the  various reasons that CSRF occurs and provide payload examples to target those  specific issues and variations. We'll see live demos of these attacks and the  protections against them. Next we'll look at how to compose these primitives  into a complete solution capable of solving most cases of CSRF explaining the  limits and how to layer them to address potential short comings. Finally  we'll finish by looking at Same Site Cookies, a new extension to cookies that  could be the final nail in the coffin, and see how to use the prior solution  as a graceful degradation for user agents that don't support it yet.",

   "description" : "Traditional techniques for C2 channels, exfiltration,  surveillance, and exploitation are often frustrated by the growing  sophistication and prevalence of security protections, monitoring solutions,  and controls. Whilst all is definitely not lost, from an attacker's  perspective - we constantly see examples of attackers creatively bypassing  such protections - it is always beneficial to have more weapons in one's  arsenal, particularly when coming up against heavily-defended networks and  highly-secured environments.    This talk demonstrates a number of techniques and attacks which leverage  light and/or sound, using off-the-shelf hardware. It covers everything from  C2 channels and exfiltration using light and near-ultrasonic sound, to  disabling and disrupting motion detectors; from laser microphones, to  repelling drones; from trolling friends, to jamming speech and demotivating  malware analysts.    This talk not only provides attendees with a new suite of techniques and  methodologies to consider when coming up against a well-defended target, but  also demonstrates, in a hopefully fun and practical way, how these techniques  work, their advantages, disadvantages, and possible future developments. It  also gives details of real case studies where some of these techniques have  been used, and provides defenders with realistic methods for the mitigation  of these attacks.    Finally, the talk covers some ideas for future research in this area.",

   "description" : "A massive attack against old magnetic stripe information could  be executed with precision implementing new technology. In the past, a  malicious individual could spoof magstripe data but in a slow and difficult  way. Also brute force attacks were tedious and time-consuming. Technology  like Bluetooth could be used today to make a persistent attack in multiple  magnetic card readers at the same time with audio spoof.    Private companies, banks, trains, subways, hotels, schools and many others  services are still using magstripe information to even make monetary  transactions, authorize access or to generate new protocols like  MST(Magnetic Secure Transmission) During decades the exploitation of  magstripe information was an acceptable risk for many companies because the  difficulty to achieve massive attacks simultaneously was not factible. But  today is different.    Transmitting magstripe information in audio files is the faster and easier  way to make a cross-platform magstripe spoofer. But how an attacker could  transmit the audio spoof information to many magnetic card readers at the  same time? In this talk, we will discuss how an attacker could send specific  data or achieve a magstripe jammer for credit card terminals, PoS or any card  reader. Also, how it could be implemented to generate brute force attacks  against hotel door locks or tokenization processes as examples.",

   "description" : "Today there is practically a year-round CTF circuit, on which  teams hone their skills, win prizes and attain stature. For many, the ultimate goal is to dominate  in the utmost competition, DEF CON's CTF, and walk away with a coveted black  badge. Capture-the-Flag (CTF) is one  of DEF CON's oldest contests, dating back to DEF CON 4. Over the past decades, the perennial  contest has matured into an annual event requiring months of preparation and  nearly continuous dedication both of players and organizers. Organizers strive to make the events unique  while taking extreme measures to prevent games from being gamed. Participants often have to cope with novel  challenges while simultaneously demonstrating continued excellence in domains  like reverse engineering, vulnerability discovery, exploitation, digital  forensics, cryptography, and network security. In this session, we will present the  evolution of DEF CON CTF, highlighting key points of advancement in the CTF  culture - most of which broke new ground and are now present in other  contests run around the world.  Capitalizing on the multi-year tenure of recent DEF CON CTF  organizers, we are able to concisely represent over 20 years of organizers on  a single panel. Where else can you ask  cross-generational questions about challenges of running CTF? Where else can you inquire about  evolutionary design, and get answers from those that actually did it? Where else can you ask about hidden  challenges, secrets, and CTF lore...from whom it originated?    The panelists represent over 20 years of DEF CON CTF organizers. Staples in the CTF community are present  comprising of decades of experience in participating and organizing  CTFs. On stage we have past organizers  representing Legit BS, DDTEK, Kenshoto, Ghetto Hackers, and before -- many of  which also participated as part of top recurring teams such as Sk3wl of r00t,  Ghetto Hackers, Samurai, and Team Awesome.  Many also played some role (infrastructure, challenge author,  announcer) in the Cyber Grand Challenge culminating last summer at DEF  CON. They have received and  distributed dozens of black badges.  Panelists and the roles they represent for this panel: Hawaii John,  Legit Business Syndicate; Chris Eagle, DDTEK; Invisigoth, Kenshoto; Caezar,  Ghetto Hackers; Myles, Goon.",

   "description" : "Kernel bug is always very difficult to reproduce and may lead  to the entire system panic and restart. In practice, kernel debugging is the  only way to analyze panic scenes. However, implementing such a technique in  real world is not an easy task since kernel code cannot be executed in the  debugger, thus is hard to be tracked. Luckily, macOS has provided a very  powerful kernel debugging mechanism, KDK (Kernel Development Kit), to assist  people to analyze and develop kernel exploits. While for iOS, although there  is no official kernel debugger, it is also possible for us to achieve kernel  debugging by leveraging some tricks.      In this talk, we will share some kernel debugging techniques and their  corresponding tricks on the latest iOS/macOS. In addition, we will also  introduce the new kernel heap mitigation mechanisms on iOS 10/macOS 10.12 and  two heap feng shui techniques to bypass them. Finally, we will demonstrate  how to debug a concrete kernel heap overflow bug and then leverage our new  heap feng shui techniques to gain arbitrary kernel memory read/write on the  iOS 10.2/macOS 10.12.

In the spirit of \"if you can't beat'em, join'em,\"  Kasparov has explored that potential for the 20 years since his loss to Deep  Blue. Navigating a practical and hopeful approach between the utopian and  dystopian camps, Kasparov focuses on how we can rise to the challenge of the  AI revolution despite job losses to automation and refuting those who say our  technology is making us less human.

You might have some questions: does the  software work? how accurate is  it? how did it get the results that it  did? Unfortunately, the software isn't  available to the public. And you can't  get access to the source code or even a working instance of the  software. All you get are assurances  that the software is in use by investigators around the globe, and doesn't do  anything that law enforcement isn't supposed to be doing. Because you can trust the government,  right?    This talk will look at a family of tools designed for investigating peer-to-  peer networks. By synthesizing  information from dozens of search warrant affidavits, and a few technical  sources, we're able to put together at least a partial picture of the  software's capabilities. But we'll  also look at the reasons the government offers for keeping these tools out of  the public eye and talk about whether they make sense. Finally, we'll examine the implications  that investigations based on secret capabilities have for justice.",

   "description" : "Creating a custom command and control (C&C) server for  someone else's malware has a myriad of benefits. If you can take over it a  domain, you then may able to fully hijack other hackers' infected hosts. A  more prosaic benefit is expediting analysis. While hackers and governments  may be more interested in the former, malware analysts can benefit from the  later     FruitFly, the first OS X/macOS malware of 2017, is a rather intriguing  specimen. Selectively targeting biomedical research institutions, it is  thought to have flown under the radar for many years. In this talk, we'll  focus on the 'B' variant of FruitFly that even now, is only detected by a  handful of security products.    We'll begin by analyzing the malware's dropper, an  obfuscated perl script. As this language is rather archaic and uncommon in  malware droppers, we'll discuss some debugging techniques and fully  deconstruct the script.     While this dropper component also communicates with the C&C server  and supports some basic commands, it drops a binary payload in order to  perform more complex actions. However, instead of fully reversing this piece  of the malware, the talk will focus on an initial triage and show how this  was sufficient for the creation of a custom C&C server. With such a  server, we can easily coerce the malware to reveal it's full capabilities.  For example, the malware invokes a handful of low-level mouse & graphics  APIs, passing in a variety of dynamic parameters. Instead of spending hours  reversing and debugging this complex code, via the C&C server, we can  simply send it various commands and observe the effects.     Of course this approach hinges on the ability to closely observe the  malware's actions. As such, we'll discuss macOS-specific tools that can  monitor various events, and where necessary detail the creation of custom  ones (e.g. a 'mouse sniffer' that locally observes and decodes commands sent  from the malware to the OS, in order to control the mouse).    While some of this talk is FruitFly and/or macOS specific, conceptually it  should broadly apply to analyzing other malware, even on other operating  systems :)",

   "description" : "Psychographic targeting and the so called \"Weaponized AI  Propaganda Machine\" have been blamed for swaying public opinion in  recent political campaigns. But how effective are they? Why are people so  divided on certain topics? And what influences their views? This talk  presents the results of five studies exploring each of these questions. The  studies examined authoritarianism, threat perception, personality-targeted  advertising and biases in relation to support for communication surveillance  as a counter-terrorism strategy. We found that people with an authoritarian  disposition were more likely to be supportive of surveillance, but that those  who are less authoritarian became increasingly supportive of such  surveillance the greater they perceived the threat of terrorism. Using  psychographic targeting we reached Facebook audiences with significantly  different views on surveillance and demonstrated how tailoring pro and  anti-surveillance ads based on authoritarianism affected return on marketing  investment. Finally, we show how debunking propaganda faces big challenges as  biases severely limit a person's ability to interpret evidence which runs  contrary to their beliefs. The results illustrate the effectiveness of  psychographic targeting and the ease with which individuals' inherent  differences and biases can be exploited.  ",

This  device is affordable and have a lot of features and can be programmed in  Python rather than C++ like the Arduino. When we discovered this initiative  in 2016, we quickly thought it was possible to turn this tiny device into  some kind of super-duper portable wireless attack tool, as it is based on a  well-known 2.4GHz RF chip produced by Nordic Semiconductor.    It  took us a few months to hack into the Micro:Bit firmware and turn it into a  powerful attack tool able to sniff keystrokes from wireless keyboards or to  hijack and take complete control of quadcopters during flight. We also  developed many tools allowing security researchers to interact with  proprietary 2.4GHz protocols, such as an improved sniffer inspired by the  mousejack tools designed by Bastille. We will release the source code of our  firmware and related tools during the conference.    The Micro:Bit  will become a nifty platform to create portable RF attack tools and ease the  life of security researchers dealing with 2.4GHz protocols !    ",

Smart  contracts are a key part of the applications being created by the Enterprise  Ethereum Alliance, Quorum, and smaller projects in financial and other  companies. Ethical hacking of smart contracts is a critical new service that  is needed. And as is the case with coders of Solidity (the language of  Ethereum smart contracts), hackers able to find security flaws in the code  are in high demand.  Join Konstantinos for an introduction to a  methodology that can be applied to Solidity code review ... and potentially  adapted to other smart contract projects.

   "description" : "We propose a new exploit technique that brings a whole-new  attack surface to bypass SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) protections. This  is a very general attack approach, in which we used in combination with our  own fuzzing tool to discover many 0days in built-in libraries of very  widely-used programming languages, including Python, PHP, Perl, Ruby, Java,  JavaScript, Wget and cURL. The root cause of the problem lies in the  inconsistency of URL parsers and URL requesters.    Being a very fundamental  problem that exists in built-in libraries, sophisticated web applications  such as WordPress (27% of the Web), vBulletin, MyBB and GitHub can also  suffer, and 0days have been discovered in them via this technique. This  general technique can also adapt to various code contexts and lead to  protocol smuggling and SSRF bypassing. Several scenarios will be demonstrated  to illustrate how URL parsers can be exploited to bypass SSRF protection and  achieve RCE (Remote Code Execution), which is the case in our GitHub  Enterprise demo.    Understanding the basics of this technique, the audience won't be surprised  to know that more than 20 vulnerabilities have been found in famous  programming languages and web applications aforementioned via this technique.",

   "description" : "In the wake of recent presidential elections in the US and  France, \"hacking\" has   taken on new political and social dimensions around the globe. We are now faced  with a world of complex influence  operations and dubious integrity of information.   What does that imply for democratic institutions, legitimacy, and public  confidence?    This session will explore how liberal democracy can be hacked  -- ranging from direct   manipulation of electronic voting tallies or voter registration lists to  indirect influence   over mass media and voter preferences -- and question the future role of  \"truth\" in  open societies.  Both domestic partisan activities and foreign interventions will be    considered on technical, legal, and philosophical grounds. The speaker will build   on his experience  as an intelligence professional to analyze foreign capabilities and   intentions in the cyber sphere in order to forecast the future of  information warfare.   Audience members will be engaged in a Socratic  dialogue to think through how   modern technologies can be used to propagate memes and influence the  electorate.  The feasibility of, and public policy challenges associated with, various  approaches   to hacking democracy will also be considered. This conceptual discussion of strategic    influence campaigns will not require any specific technical or legal  knowledge",

   "description" : "We'd like to introduce you to one of the most devastating ways  to cause service instability in modern micro-service architectures:  application DDoS. Unlike traditional  network DDoS that focuses on network pipes and edge resources, our talk  focuses on identifying and targeting expensive calls within a micro-services  architecture, using their complex interconnected relationships to cause the  system to attack itself -- with massive effect. In modern microservice architectures it's  easier to cause service instability with sophisticated requests that model  legitimate traffic to pass right through web application firewalls.     We will discuss  how the Netflix application security team identified areas of our  microservices that laid the groundwork for these exponential-work  attacks. We'll step through one case  study of how a single request into an API endpoint fans out through the  application fabric and results in an exponential set of dependent service  calls. Disrupting even one point  within the dependency graph can have a cascading effect throughout not only  the initial endpoint, but the dependent services backing other related API  services.    We will then discuss the frameworks we collaborated on building that refine  the automation and reproducibility of testing the endpoints, which we've  already successfully leveraged against our live production environment. We  will provide a demonstration of the frameworks which will be open sourced in  conjunction with this presentation. Attendees will leave this talk  understanding architectural and technical approaches to identify and  remediate application DDoS vulnerabilities within their own  applications. Attendees will also gain  a greater understanding on how take a novel new attack methodology and build  an orchestration framework that can be used at a global scale.",

   "description" : "Millions of people around the world use Tor every day to  protect themselves from surveillance and censorship. While most people use  Tor to reach ordinary websites more safely, a tiny fraction of Tor traffic  makes up what overhyped journalists like to call the \"dark web\".  Tor onion services (formerly known as Tor hidden services) let people run  Internet services such as websites in a way where both the service and the  people reaching it can get stronger security and privacy.    I wrote  the original onion service code as a toy example in 2004, and it sure is  showing its age. In particular, mistakes in the original protocol are now  being actively exploited by fear-mongering \"threat intelligence\"  companies to build lists of onion services even when the service operators  thought they would stay under the radar.    These design flaws are a problem because people rely on onion services for  many cool use cases, like metadata-free chat and file sharing, safe  interaction between journalists and their sources, safe software updates, and  more secure ways to reach popular websites like Facebook.    In this talk I'll present our new and improved onion service design, which  provides stronger security and better scalability. I'll also publish a new  release of the Tor software that lets people use the new design.",

   "description" : "Ever get an uneasy feeling when an installer asks for your  password? Well, your gut was right! The majority of macOS installers &  updaters are vulnerable to a wide range of priv-esc attacks.    It began with the discovery that Apple's OS updater  could be abused to bypass SIP (CVE-2017-6974). Next, turns out Apple's core  installer app may be subverted to load unsigned dylibs which may elevate  privileges to root.    And what about 3rd-party installers? I looked at what's installed on  my Mac, and ahhh, so many bugs!     Firewall, Little Snitch: EoP via race condition of insecure plist  Anti-Virus, Sophos: EoP via hijack of binary component   Browser, Google Chrome: EoP via script hijack  Virtualization, VMWare  Fusion: EoP via race condition of insecure script  IoT, DropCam: EoP via hijack of binary component  and more!    ...and 3rd-party auto-update frameworks like Sparkle -yup vulnerable  too!    Though root is great, we can't bypass SIP nor load unsigned  kexts. However with root, I discovered one could now trigger a ring-0  heap-overflow that provides complete system control.    Though the talk will discuss a variety of discovery mechanisms, 0days, and  macOS exploitation techniques, it won't be all doom & gloom. We'll end by  discussing ways to perform authorized installs/upgrades that don't undermine  system security.\"  ",

   "description" : "In February 2017, we announced the first SHA-1 collision. This  collision combined with a clever use of the PDF format allows attackers to  forge PDF pairs that have identical SHA-1 hashes and yet display different  content. This attack is the result of over two years of intense research. It  took 6500 CPU years and 110 GPU years of computations which is still 100,000  times faster than a brute-force attack.     In this talk, we recount how we found the first SHA-1 collision. We delve  into the challenges we faced from developing a meaningful payload, to scaling  the computation to that massive scale, to solving unexpected cryptanalytic  challenges that occurred during this endeavor.    We discuss the aftermath of the release including the positive  changes it brought and its unforeseen consequences. For example it was  discovered that SVN is vulnerable to SHA-1 collision attacks only after the  WebKit SVN repository was brought down by the commit of a unit-test aimed at  verifying that Webkit is immune to collision attacks.     Building on the Github and Gmail examples we explain how to use  counter-cryptanalysis to mitigate the risk of a collision attacks against  software that has yet to move away from SHA-1. Finally we look at the next  generation of hash functions and what the future of hash security holds",

The talk will present a novel way of exploiting common web  applications like Wordpress, Joomla or Typo3 with the help of Certificate  Transparency.    Certificate Transparency has helped uncover various incidents in the past  where certificate authorities have violated rules. It is probably one of the  most important security improvements that has ever happened in the  certificate authority ecosystem. In September 2017 Google will make  Certificate Transparency mandatory for all new certificates. So it's a good  time to see how it could be abused by the bad guys.  ",

   "description" : "What do the Dallas tornado siren attack, hacked electric  skateboards, and insecure smart door locks have in common? Vulnerable  wireless protocols. Exploitation of wireless devices is growing increasingly  common, thanks to the proliferation of radio frequency protocols driven by  mobile and IoT. While non-Wi-Fi and non-Bluetooth RF protocols remain a  mystery to many security practitioners, exploiting them is easier than one  might think.    Join us as we walk through the fundamentals of radio exploitation.  After introducing essential RF concepts and characteristics, we will develop  a wireless threat taxonomy by analyzing and classifying different methods of  attack. As we introduce each new attack, we will draw parallels to similar  wired network exploits, and highlight attack primitives that are unique to  RF. To illustrate these concepts, we will show each attack in practice with a  series of live demos built on software-defined and hardware radios.    Attendees will come away from this  session with an understanding of the mechanics of wireless network  exploitation, and an awareness of how they can bridge their IP network  exploitation skills to the wireless domain.",

   "description" : "Everyone loves cloud-AV. Why not harness the wisdom of clouds  to protect the enterprise? Consider a high-security enterprise with strict  egress filtering - endpoints have no direct Internet connection, or the  endpoints' connection to the Internet is restricted to hosts used by their  legitimately installed software. Let's say there's malware running on an  endpoint with full privileges. The malware still can't exfiltrate data due to  the strict egress filtering.    Now let's also assume that this  enterprise uses cloud-enhanced anti-virus (AV).You'd argue that if malware is  already running on the endpoint with full privileges, then an AV agent can't  degrade the security of the endpoint. And you'd be completely wrong.    In this presentation,  we describe and demonstrate a novel technique for exfiltrating data from  highly secure enterprises which employ strict egress filtering. Assuming the  endpoint has a cloud-enhanced antivirus installed, we show that if the AV  employs an Internet-connected sandbox in its cloud, it in fact facilitates  such exfiltration. We release a tool implementing the exfiltration technique,  and provide real-world results from several prominent AV products. We also  provide insights on AV in-the-cloud sandboxes. Finally we address the issues  of how to further enhance the attack, and possible mitigations.",

   "description" : "Active Directory (AD) object discretionary access control  lists (DACLs) are an untapped offensive landscape, often overlooked by  attackers and defenders alike. The control relationships between AD objects  align perfectly with the \"attackers think in graphs\" philosophy and  expose an entire class of previously unseen control edges, dramatically  expanding the number of paths to complete domain compromise.    While DACL misconfigurations can provide numerous paths that facilitate  elevation of domain rights, they also present a unique chance to covertly  deploy Active Directory persistence. It's often difficult to determine  whether a specific AD DACL misconfiguration was set intentionally or  implemented by accident. This makes Active Directory DACL backdoors an  excellent persistence opportunity: minimal forensic footprint, and maximum  plausible deniability.    This talk will cover Active Directory DACLs in depth, our  \"misconfiguration taxonomy\", and enumeration/analysis with  BloodHound's newly released feature set. We will cover the abuse of AD DACL  misconfigurations for the purpose of domain rights elevation, including  common misconfigurations encountered in the wild. We will then cover methods  to design AD DACL backdoors, including ways to evade current detections, and  will conclude with defensive mitigation/detection techniques for everything  described.",

   "description" : "On March 17th, Cisco Systems Inc. made a public announcement  that over 300 of the switches it manufactures are prone to a critical  vulnerability that allows a potential attacker to take full control of the  network equipment.    This damaging public announcement was  preceded by Wikileaks's publication of documents codenamed as \"Vault  7\" which contained information on vulnerabilities and description of  tools needed to access phones, network equipment and even IOT devices.    Cisco  Systems Inc. had a huge task in front of them - patching this vast amount of  different switch models is not an easy task. The remediation for this  vulnerability was available with the initial advisory and patched versions of  IOS software were announced on May 8th 2017.    We all heard about modern exploit mitigation techniques such as Data  Execution Prevention, Layout Randomization. But just how hardened is the  network equipment? And how hard is it to find critical vulnerabilities?     To answer that question I decided to reproduce the steps necessary to create  a fully working tool to get remote code execution on Cisco switches mentioned  in the public announcement.    This presentation is a detailed write-up of the  exploit development process for the vulnerability in Cisco Cluster Management  Protocol that allows a full takeover of the device.",

   "description" : "Women's health is big business. There are a staggering number  of applications for Android to help people keep track of their monthly cycle,  know when they may be fertile, or track the status of their pregnancy. These  apps entice the user to input the most intimate details of their lives, such  as their mood, sexual activity, physical activity, physical symptoms, height,  weight, and more. But how private are these apps, and how secure are they  really? After all, if an app has such intimate details about our private  lives it would make sense to ensure that it is not sharing those details with  anyone such as another company or an abusive partner/parent. To this end EFF  and Journalist Kashmir Hill have taken a look at some of the privacy and  security properties of over a dozen different fertility and pregnancy  tracking apps. Through our research we have uncovered several privacy issues  in many of the applications as well as some notable security flaws as well as  a couple of interesting security features.",

(i.e.: Sales vs Engineering, Government vs Private sector etc) .  The talk will showcase publicly known historical cases and personal  experiences where translation errors (accidental and deliberate) have lead to  misunderstandings some with dire consequences. Also the talk will showcase  using translators as an offensive tool (i.e.:How to create more credible fake  news). We as a society consume more information and consume it faster than  before, we have to be aware of the dangers that are inherit with bad  translations. Also the infosec/cyber security profession because of the  potential for large scale global impacts  and or the need to maintain operational security poses unique  considerations when translating or using a translator.

   "description" : "One software product that red teamers will almost certainly  find on any compromised workstation is Microsoft Office. This talk will discuss the ways that native  functionality within Office can be abused to obtain persistence. The following opportunities for  Office-based persistence will be discussed:     (1) WLL and XLL add-ins for Word  and Excel - a legacy add-in that allows arbitrary DLL loading.   (2) VBA add-ins for Excel and  PowerPoint - an alternative to backdoored template files, which executes  whenever the applications load.

Each persistence mechanism will be discussed in terms of its relative  advantages and disadvantages for red teamers.  In particular, with regards to their complexity to deploy, privilege  requirements, and applicability to Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)  environments which hinder the use of many traditional persistence  mechanisms.    The talk isn't all red - there's also some blue to satisfy the threat  hunters and incident responders amongst us. The talk will finish with  approaches to detection and prevention of these persistence mechanisms.",

   "description" : "In the past few years, attacks against industrial control  systems (ICS) have increased year over year. Stuxnet in 2010 exploited the  insecurity of the S7Comm protocol, the communication protocol used between  Siemens Simatic S7 PLCs to cause serious damage in nuclear power facilities.  After the exposure of Stuxnet, Siemens has implemented some security  reinforcements into the S7Comm protocol. The current S7CommPlus protocol  implementing encryption has been used in S7-1200 V4.0 and above, as well as  S7-1500, to prevent attackers from controlling and damaging the PLC devices.    Is the current S7CommPlus a real high security protocol? This talk will  demonstrate a spear that can break the security wall of the S7CommPlus  protocol. First, we use software like Wireshark to analyze the communications  between the Siemens TIA Portal and PLC devices. Then, using reverse debugging  software like WinDbg and IDA we can break the encryption in the S7CommPlus  protocol. Finally, we write a MFC program which can control the start and the  stop of the PLC, as well as value changes of PLC's digital and analog inputs  & outputs.  Based on the research above, we present two security proposals at both code  level and protocol level to improve the security of Siemens PLC devices.",

   "description" : "Wind farms are becoming a leading source for renewable energy.  The increased reliance on wind energy makes wind farm control systems  attractive targets for attackers. This talk explains how wind farm control  networks work and how they can be attacked in order to negatively influence  wind farm operations (e.g., wind turbine hijacking). Specifically,  implementations of the IEC 61400-25 family of communications protocols are  investigated (i.e., OPC XML-DA). This research is based on an empirical study  of a variety of U.S. based wind farms conducted over a two year period. We  explain how these security assessments reveal that wind farm vendor design  and implementation flaws have left wind turbine programmable automation  controllers and OPC servers vulnerable to attack. Additionally,  proof-of-concept attack tools are developed in order to exploit wind farm  control network design and implementation vulnerabilities.",

The last target is further in  the network, non accessible and heavily filtered. Thankfully, one last hope  remains. You realize the target domain pulls its updates from the WSUS server  of the compromised domain, the one you fully control. Hope is back... But  once again, it fails. The only tools available for controlling the updates  are not working: they require a network attack that is prevented by the  network architecture and the server configuration. All hope is lost...  We will present you a new approach, allowing you to circumvent these  limitations and to exploit this situation in order to deliver updates. Thus,  you will be able to control the targeted network from the very WSUS server  you own. By extension, this approach may serve as a basis for an air gap  attack for disconnected networks.  Our talk will describe vulnerable  architectures to this approach and also make some in-context demonstration of  the attack with new public tooling. Finally, as nothing is inescapable, we  will also explain how you can protect your update architecture.",

This technical talk will cover the basic concepts  of microservices and FaaS, and how to use them to scale time consuming  offensive security testing tasks. Attacks that were previously considered  impractical due to time and resource constraints can now be considered  feasible with the availability of cloud services and the never-ending free  flow of public IP addresses to avoid attribution and blacklists.    Key takeaways include a guide to scaling your tools and a demonstration on  the practical benefits of utilising cloud services in performing undetected  port scans, opportunistic attacks against short lived network services,  brute-force attacks on services and OTP values, and creating your own whois  database, shodan/censys, and searching for the elusive internet accessible  IPv6 hosts.",

   "description" : "The International, a recent esports tournament, had a 20  million dollar prize pool with over five million people tuned in to the final  match. The high stakes environment at tournaments creates an incentive for  players to cheat for a competitive advantage. Cheaters are always finding new  ways to modify software, from attempting to sneak executables in on flash  drives, to using cheats stored in Steam's online workshop which bypasses IP  restrictions.    This presentation describes how one can circumvent  existing security controls to sneak a payload (game cheat) onto a target  computer. Esports tournaments typically allow players to provide their own  mouse and keyboard, as these players prefer to use specific devices or may be  obligated to use a sponsor branded device. These \"simple\" USB input  devices can still be used to execute complex commands on a computer via the  USB Human Interface Device (HID) protocol.    Our attack vector is a mouse with an ARM Cortex M series processor.  The microcontroller stores custom user profiles in flash memory, allowing the  mouse to retain user settings between multiple computers. We modify the  device's firmware to execute a payload delivery program, stored in free space  in flash memory, before returning the mouse to its original functionality.  Retaining original functionality allows the mouse to be used discreetly, as  it is an \"expected\" device at these tournaments. This concept  applies to any USB device that uses this processor, and does not require  obvious physical modifications.     This delivery method has tradeoffs. Our exploit is observable, as windows  are created and in focus during payload delivery. The advantage to this  approach is that it bypasses other security measures that are commonly in  place, such as filtered internet traffic and disabled USB mass storage.",

Reinforcement learning has produced game-changing AI's that top human level performance in the game of Go and a myriad of hacked retro Atari games (e.g., Pong). In an analogous fashion, we demonstrate an AI agent that has learned through thousands of \"games\" against a next-gen AV malware detector which sequence of functionality-preserving changes to perform on a Windows PE malware file so that it bypasses the detector.

Problem is - the first leg of connectivity to your C2 is  denied. Your DNS and ICMP traffic is being monitored. Access to your cloud  drives is restricted. You've implemented domain fronting for your C2 only to  discover it is ranked low by the content proxy, which is only allowing access  to a handful of business related websites on the outside.     We have all been there, seeing frustrating proxy denies or triggering  security alarms making our presence known.  Having more choices when it comes to outbound network connectivity helps. In  this talk we'll present a technique to establish such connectivity with the  help of HTTP callbacks (webhooks). We will walk you through what webhooks  are, how they are used by organizations. We will then discuss how you can use  approved sites as brokers of your communication, perform data transfers,  establish almost realtime asynchronous command execution, and even create a  command-and-control communication over them, bypassing strict defensive  proxies, and even avoiding attribution.      Finally, we'll release the tool that will use the  concept of a broker website to work with the external C2 using webhooks.",

   "description" : "Get over it! as Scott McNeeley said - unhelpfully. Only if we  understand why it is gone and not coming back do we have a shot at rethinking  what privacy means in a new context. Thieme goes deep and wide as he rethinks  the place of privacy in the new social/cultural context and challenges  contemporary discussions to stop using 20th century frames. Pictures don't  fit those frames, including pictures of \"ourselves.\" .   We have always known we were cells in a body, but we emphasized cell-ness.  Now we have to emphasize body-ness and see ourselves differently. What we  see depends on the level of abstraction at which we look. The boundaries we  imagine around identities, psyches, private internal spaces,\" are  violated in both directions, going in and going out, by data that, when  aggregated, constitutes us. We are known by others more deeply in  recombination from metadata than we know ourselves. We are not who we think  we are.  To understand privacy - even what we mean by individuals\"  who want it - requires a contrary opinion. Privacy is honored in lip service,  but not in the marketplace, where it is violated every day. To confront the  challenges of technological change, we have to know what is happening to  \"us\" so we can re-imagine what we mean by privacy, security, and  identity. We can't say what we can't think. We need new language to grasp our  own new \"human nature\" that has been reconstituted from elements  like orange juice.     The weakest link in discussions of privacy is the definition of privacy, and  the definition of privacy is not what we think. Buddhists call enlightenment  a nightmare in daylight, yet it is enlightenment still, and that kind of  clarity is the goal of this presentation.",

   "description" : "You've planned this engagement for weeks. Everything's mapped  out. You have tested all your proxy and VPN connections. You are confident  your anonymity will be protected. You fire off the first round and begin  attacking your target. Suddenly something goes south. Your access to the  target site is completely blocked no matter what proxy or VPN you use. Soon,  your ISP contacts you reminding you of their TOS while referencing complaints  from the target of your engagement. You quickly switch MAC addresses and  retry only to find that you are quickly blocked again!    What happened? How were you betrayed? The culprit? Your dastardly DNS  resolvers and more specifically, the use of certain EDNS0 options by those  resolvers.  This presentation will cover the ways in which EDNS OPT code  data can divulge details about your online activity, look at methods for  discovering implementation by upstream DNS providers and discuss ways in  which malicious actors can abuse these features. We will also examine steps  you can take to protect yourself from these invasive disclosures.     The details covered will be only moderately technical. Having a basic  understanding of RFC 6891 and general DNS processes will help in  understanding. We will discuss the use of basic tools including Wireshark,  Packetbeat, Graylog and Dig.",

   "description" : "Koadic C3, or COM Command & Control, is a Windows  post-exploitation tool similar to other penetration testing rootkits such as  Meterpreter and Powershell Empire. The major difference is that Koadic does  most of its operations using the Windows Script Host (a.k.a.  JScript/VBScript), with compatibility in the core to support a default  installation of Windows 2000 with no service packs (and potentially even  versions of NT4) all the way through Windows 10.    An in-depth view of default COM objects  will be provided. COM is a fairly underexplored, large attack surface in  Windows. We will share lots of weird Windows scripting quirks with  interesting workarounds we discovered during the course of development. Post  exploitation with PowerShell has grown in popularity in recent years, and  seeing what can be done with just the basic Windows Script Host is an  interesting exploration. In addition, defenses against this type of tool will  be discussed, as the Windows Script Host is more tightly coupled to the core  of Windows than PowerShell is.    It is possible to serve payloads completely in memory from stage 0 to  beyond, as well as use cryptographically secure communications over SSL and  TLS (depending on what the victim OS has available). We also found numerous  ways to \"fork to shellcode\" in an environment which traditionally  does not provide such capabilities. This talk is based on original research  by ourselves, as well as the previous amazing work of engima0x3, subTee, tiraniddo,  and others.",

   "description" : "In theme with this year's DEF CON this presentation goes through a 20 year  history of exploiting massively multiplayer online role-playing games  (MMORPGs). The presentation technically analyzes some of the virtual economy-devastating,  low-hanging-fruit exploits that are common in nearly every MMORPG released to  date. The presenter, Manfred (@_EBFE), goes over his adventures in hacking  online games starting with 1997's Ultima Online and subsequent games such as  Dark Age of Camelot, Anarchy Online, Asherons Call 2, ShadowBane, Lineage II,  Final Fantasy XI/XIV, World of Warcraft, plus some more recent titles such as  Guild Wars 2 and Elder Scrolls Online and many more!    The presentation briefly covers the exploit  development versus exploit detection/prevention arms race and its current  state. Detailed packet analysis and inference on what the code looks like  server side in order for some of the exploits to be possible is  presented.    This presentation includes a live demonstration of at  least one unreleased exploit to create mass amounts of virtual currency in a  recent and popular MMORPG.\\n  ",

   "description" : "Images, videos and other digital media provide a convenient  and expressive way to communicate through social networks. But such  broadcastable and information-rich content provides ample illicit opportunity  as well. Web-prevalent image files like JPEGs can be disguised with foreign  data since they're perceivably robust to minor pixel and metadata  alterations. Slipping a covert message into one of the billions of daily  posted images may be possible, but to what extent can steganography be  systematically automated and scaled?    To explore this, we first report the distorting side effects rendered upon  images uploaded to popular social network servers, e.g. compression,  resizing, format conversion, and metadata stripping. Then, we build a convolutional  neural network that learns to reverse engineer these transformations by  optimizing hidden data throughput capacity. From pre-uploaded and downloaded  image files, the network learns to locate candidate metadata and pixels that  are least modifiable during transit, allowing stored hidden payloads to be  reliably recalled from newly presented images. Deep learning typically  requires tons of training data to avoid over fitting. But data acquisition is  trivial using social networks' free image hosting services, which feature  bulk uploads and downloads of thousands of images at a time per album.     We show that hidden data can be predictably transmitted through social  network images with high fidelity. Our results demonstrate that AI can hide  data in plain sight, at large-scale, beyond human visual discernment, and  despite third-party manipulation. Steganalysis and other defensive forensic  countermeasures are notoriously difficult, and our exfiltration techniques  highlight the growing threat posed by automated, AI-powered red teaming.",

   "description" : "Autonomic systems are smart systems which do not need any  human management or intervention. Cisco is one of the first companies to  deploy the technology in which the routers are just \"Plug and Play\"  with no need for configuration. All that is needed is 5 commands to build  fully automated network. It is already supported in pretty much all of the  recent software images for enterprise level and carrier grade  routers/switches.    This is the bright side of the technology. On the other hand,  the configuration is hidden and the interfaces are inaccessible. The protocol  is proprietary and there is no mechanism to know what is running within your  network.    In this talk, we will have a quick overview on Cisco's Autonomic Network  Architecture, then I will reverse-engineer the proprietary protocol through  its multiple phases. Finally, multiple vulnerabilities (overall 5) will be  presented, one of which allows to crash systems remotely by knowing their  IPv6 address.",

   "description" : "The current consensus within the security industry is that  high-assurance systems cannot tolerate the presence of compromised hardware  components. In this talk, we challenge this perception and demonstrate how  trusted, high-assurance hardware can be built from untrusted and potentially  malicious components.    The majority of IC vendors outsource the fabrication of their designs to  facilities overseas, and rely on post-fabrication tests to weed out deficient  chips. However, such tests are not effective against: 1) subtle unintentional  errors (e.g., malfunctioning RNGs) and 2) malicious circuitry (e.g., stealthy  Hardware Trojans). Such errors are very hard to detect and require constant  upgrades of expensive forensics equipment, which contradicts the motives of  fabrication outsourcing.    In this session, we introduce a high-level architecture that can tolerate  multiple, malicious hardware components, and outline a new approach in  hardware compromises risk management. We first demo our backdoor-tolerant  Hardware Security Module built from low-cost commercial off-the-shelf  components, benchmark its performance, and delve into its internals. We then  explain the importance of \"component diversification\" and  \"non-overlapping supply chains\", and finally discuss how  \"mutual distrust\" can be exploited to further reduce the  capabilities of the adversaries.

   "description" : "XenoScan is the next generation in tooling for hardcore game  hackers. Building on the solid foundation from older tools like Cheat Engine  and Tsearch, XenoScan makes many innovations which take memory scanning to a  whole new level.    This demo-heavy talk will skip the fluff and  show the power of the tool in real-time. The talk will demonstrate how the  tool can scan for partial structures, detect complex data structures such as  binary trees or linked lists, detect class-instances living on the heap, and  even group detected class instances by their types. Additional, these demos  will take a look at the tool's extensibility by working not only on native  processes, but also on Nintendo games running in emulators. You're not all  game hackers, so the talk will also show how XenoScan can be useful in the  day-to-day workflow of reverse engineers and hackers.    When I'm not doing demos, I'll be drilling down to the low-level to talk  about the nitty gritty details of what's happening, how it works, and why it  works.    By the end of the talk, you'll see the true power of a well-made, smart  memory scanner. You'll be empowered to use it in your day to day hacking,  whether that is on games, malware, or otherwise. For those of you that are  really interested in the tool, it is completely open-source and all  development is done on an interactive livestream, meaning you can participate  in and learn from future development.

   "description" : "In response to public security breaches many retailers have  begun efforts to minimize or completely prevent the transmission of  unencrypted credit card data through their store networks and point of sale  systems. While this is definitely a great improvement over the previous state  of affairs; it places the security of transactions squarely in the hands of  credit card terminals purchased from third party vendors. These terminals  have a security posture that is often not well understood by the retail chains  purchasing them. To better understand if the trust placed in these devices is  warranted, the attack surface and hardening of a commonly deployed credit  card terminal series is reviewed and a discussion of reverse engineered  security APIs is presented. Despite the reduced attack surface of the  terminals and hardened configuration, attacks that allow recovery of  magstripe track data and PIN codes are demonstrated to be possible.",

   "description" : "Every year thousands of organizations are compromised by  targeted attacks. In many cases the attacks are labeled as advanced and  persistent which suggests a high level of sophistication in the attack and  tools used. Many times, this title is leveraged as an excuse that the events  were inevitable or irresistible, as if the assailants' skill set is well  beyond what defenders are capable of. To the contrary, often these assailants  are not as untouchable as many would believe.     If one looks at the  many APT reports that have been released over the years some clear patterns  start to emerge. A small number of Remote Administration Tools are preferred  by actors and reused across multiple campaigns. Frequently sited tools  include Gh0st RAT, Plug-X, and XtremeRAT among others. Upon examination, the  command and control components of these notorious RATs are riddled with  vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities that can be exploited to turn the tables  from hunter to hunted.    The presentation will disclose several  exploits that could allow remote execution or remote information disclosure  on computers running these well-known C&C components. It should serve as  a warning to those actors who utilize such toolsets. That is to say, such  actors live in glass houses and should stop throwing stones.",

   "description" : "The late 80's and early 90's played a pivotal role in the  forming of the Israeli tech scene as we know it today, producing companies  like Checkpoint, Waze, Wix, Mobileye, Viber and billions of dollars in  fundraising and exits. The people who would later build that industry were in  anywhere from elementary school to high school, and their paths included some  of the best hacking stories of the time (certainly in the eyes of the  locals). The combination of extremely expensive Internet and international  dial system, non-existent legal enforcement and a lagging national phone  company could not prevent dozens of hungry-for-knowledge kids from teaching  themselves the dark arts of reversing, hacking, cracking, phreaking and even  carding. The world looked completely different back then and we have some  great stories for you. We will cover the evolution of the  many-years-later-to-be-named-Cyber community, including personal stories from  nearly all categories Come listen how the Israeli Cyber empire was born,  25 years ago, from the perspectives of 2:401/100 and 2:401/100.1.

   "description" : "        When you learned that military and law enforcement agencies had trained  screaming eagles to pluck drones from the sky, did you too find yourself  asking: \"I wonder if I could throw these eagles off my tail, maybe by  deploying delicious bacon countermeasures?\" Well you'd be wise to question just how  effective these emerging, first generation \"drone defense' solutions  really are, and which amount to little more than \"snake oil'.     There is no such thing as \"best  practices\" when it comes to defending against \"rogue drones\",  period. Over the past 2 years, new  defensive products that detect and respond to \"rogue drones' have been  crawling out of the woodwork. The vast  majority are immature, unproven solutions that require a proper vetting.     We've taken a MythBusters-style  approach to testing the effectiveness of a variety of drone defense  solutions, pitting them against our DangerDrone. Videos demonstrating the results should be  almost as fun for you to watch as they were for us to produce. Expect to witness epic aerial battles  against an assortment of drone defense types, including:    - trained eagles and falcons that  hunt \"rogue drones\"    - fighter drones that hunt and shoot  nets    - drones with large nets that swoop  in and snatch up \"rogue drones'    - surface-to-air projectile weapons,  including bazooka-like cannons that launch nets, and shotgun shells  containing nets    - signal jamming and hijacking  devices that attack drone command and control interfaces    - even frickin' laser beams and Patriot  missiles!     We'll also be releasing DangerDrone  v2.0, an upgraded version of our free Raspberry Pi-based pentesting  quadcopter (basically a ~$500 hacker's laptop, that can also fly). We'll be giving away a fully functional  DangerDrone v2.0 to one lucky audience member!     So come see what's guaranteed to be the most  entertaining talk this year and find out which of these dogs can hunt!   ",

   "description" : "Credentials have always served as a favorite target for  advanced attackers, since these allow to efficiently traverse a network,  without using any exploits.     Moreover, compromising the network might not be sufficient, as attackers  strive to obtain persistence, which requires the use of advanced techniques  to evade the security mechanisms installed along the way. One of the  challenges adversaries must face is: How to create threats that will  continuously evade security mechanisms, and even if detected, ensure that  control of the environment can be easily regained? In this talk, we briefly mention some of  the past techniques for gaining persistence in a network and discuss why they  are insufficient nowadays. Followed by a comprehensive analysis of lesser  known mechanisms, using non-mainstream methods.     We focus on how attackers may leverage various Active Directory features and  authentication mechanisms (such as object manipulation, Kerberos delegation,  etc.) to achieve persistence. Finally,  we show how defenders can secure their environment against such threats.",

HUNT is a new Burp Suite extension that aims  to arm web hackers with parameter level suggestions on where to look for  certain classes of vulnerabilities (SQLi, CMDi, LFI/RFI, and more!). This  data is parsed from hundreds of real-world assessments, providing the user  with the means to effectively root out critical issues.

Whether used for protecting legitimate apps' business logic  or hiding malicious content, Android packer usage is on the rise. Android  packers continue to increase their efforts to prevent reverse engineers and  static analysis engines from understanding what's inside the package. To do  so they employ elaborate tactics, including state of the art ELF tampering,  obfuscation and various anti-debugging techniques.    In this talk,  we will provide an overview of the packer industry and present real world  test cases. We will do a deep technical dive into the internal workings of  popular Android packers, exposing the different methods which protect the  app's code. As a countermeasure, we will provide various techniques to  circumvent them, allowing hackers and security researchers to unpack the  secrets they withhold.",

   "description" : "Existing fingerprinting mechanisms to identify client devices  on a network tend to be coarse in their identification. For example they can  tell it is an iPhone of some kind, or that it is a Samsung Android device of  some model. They might look at DHCP information to know its OS, see if the  client responds to SSDP, or check DNS-SD TXT responses.    By examining Wi-Fi Management frames we can identify the device much more  specifically. We can tell a iPhone 5S from an iPhone 5, a Samsung Galaxy S8  from an S7, an LG G5 from a G4. This talk describes how the signature  mechanism works.    Specifically identifying the client is the first step toward further scanning  or analysis of that client's behavior on the network.",

   "description" : "The security of your bitcoins rests entirely in the security  of your private key. Bitcoin hardware wallets help protect against  software-based attacks to recover or misuse your key. However, hardware  attacks on these wallets are not as well studied. In 2015, Jochen Hoenicke  was able to extract the private key from a TREZOR using a simple power  analysis technique. While that vulnerability was patched, he suggested the  Microcontroller on the TREZOR, which is also the same on the KeepKey, may be  vulnerable to additional side channel attacks.    In this presentation we will quickly overview fault injection techniques,  timing, and power analysis methods using the Open Source Hardware tool, the  ChipWhisperer. We then show how to apply these techniques to the STM32F205  which is the MCU on the Trezor and KeepKey. Lastly, we will present our  findings of a timing attack vulnerability and conclude with software and  hardware recommendations to improve bitcoin hardware wallets. We will show and share our tools and  methods to help you get started in breaking your own wallet!",

   "description" : "Modern computing platforms offer more freedom than ever before. The rise of Free and Open Source Software has led to more secure and heavily scrutinized cryptographic solutions. However, below the surface of open source operating systems, strictly closed source firmware along with device driver blobs and closed system architecture prevent users from examining, understanding, and trusting the systems where they run their private computations. Embedded technologies like Intel Management Engine pose significant threats when, not if, they get exploited. Advanced attackers in possession of firmware signing keys, and even potential access to chip fabrication, could wreak untold havoc on cryptographic devices we rely on. \r\rAfter surveying all-too-possible low level attacks on critical systems, we will introduce an alternative open source solution to peace-of-mind cryptography and private computing. By using programmable logic chips, called Field Programmable Gate Arrays, this device is more open source than any common personal computing system to date. No blobs, no hidden firmware features, and no secret closed source processors. This concept isn't \"unhacakable\", rather we believe it to be the most fixable; this is what users and hackers should ultimately be fighting for.",

   "description" : "Windows' BITS service is a middleman for your download jobs. You start a BITS job, and from that point on, BITS is responsible for the download. But what if we tell you that BITS is a careless middleman? We have uncovered the way BITS maintains its jobs queue using a state file on disk, and found a way for a local administrator to control jobs using special modifications to that file Comprehending this file's binary structure allowed us to change a job's properties (such as RemoteURL, Destination Path...) in runtime and even inject our own custom job, using none of BITS' public interfaces. This method, combined with the generous notification feature of BITS, allowed us to run a program of our will as the LocalSystem account, within session 0. So if you wish to execute your code as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM and the first options that come to mind are psexec/creating a service, we now add a new option: BITSInject. Here, we will not only introduce the practical method we formed, but also: Reveal the binary structure of the state file for you to play with, and some knowledge we gathered while researching the service flow; We will also provide free giveaways: A one-click python tool that performs  the described method; SimpleBITSServer - a pythonic BITS server; A struct  definition file, to use for parsing your BITS state file",

   "description" : "Modern Android applications are large and complex, and can be  a pain to analyze  even without obfuscation  static analysis can only get one so far, the  debugger  sucks, Frida doesn't give you enough access to the Java environment,  and  editing smali or writing Xposed hooks can be time consuming and  error prone.  There has to be a better way!    What if we could inject a command line REPL into an app to drive  functionality?  And what if we could also make writing function hooks  fast and easy?    In this talk, I will introduce ParaSpectre, a platform for dynamic analysis  of  Android applications that injects JRuby into Android applications. It  bundles a  hook configuration web API, a web application interface to  configure and edit  hooks, and a connect-back JRuby REPL to aid application exploration from  the  inside-out. It supports various selectors to match classes and methods, can  be  reconfigured on-the-fly without requiring a device reboot, and takes  the pain  out of writing method hooks for Android apps.    ParaSpectre is for developers and security researchers alike. While not  itself  a debugger, it provides a level of access into a running application that  a  debugger generally won't.",

Curiosity around these questions prompted  exploration of the research and concepts surrounding the idea of making the  authentication process more secure by implanting passwords into an  individual's memory. The result? The idea is that you are not able to reveal  your credentials under duress but you are still able to authenticate to a  system. We will begin with an understanding of cognitive memory. Implicit  versus explicit memory will be defined. The concepts of the subconscious,  unconscious, and consciousness will be addressed. The stages of memory  pertaining to encoding, storage and retrieval as well as the limitations of  human memory along with serial interception sequence learning training will  round out our build up to the current research and experimentation being done  with the proposal to implant passwords into an individual's cognitive  memory.",

   "description" : "Continuous Integration (CI) systems and similar architecture  has taken new direction, especially in the last few years. Automating code  builds, tests, and deployments is helping hordes of developers release code,  and is saving companies a great amount of time and resources. But at what  cost? The sudden and strong demand for these systems have created some widely  adopted practices that have large security implications, especially if these  systems are hosted internally. I have developed a tool that will help  automate some offensive testing against certain popular CI build systems.  There has been a large adoption of initiating these builds through web hooks  of various kinds, especially changes to public facing code repositories. I  will start with a brief overview of some of the more popular CI tools and how  they are being used in many organizations. This is good information for  understanding, at a high level, the purpose of these systems as well as some  security benefits that they can provide. From there we will dive into  specific examples of how these different CI implementations have created  vulnerabilities (in one case to a CI vendor themselves). Last we will explore  the tool, its purpose, and a demonstration of its use. This tool takes  advantage of the configurations of various components of the build chain to  look for vulnerabilities. It then has the capability to exploit, persist  access, command and control vulnerable build containers. Most of the  demonstration will revolve around specific CI products and repositories,  however the concepts are applicable across most build systems. The goal here  is to encourage further exploration of these exploitation concepts. The tool  is built modularly to facilitate this. If you are new to CI and automated build  systems, or if you have been doing it for years, this talk and tool will help  you to better secure your architecture",

   "description" : "One vulnerability in CSFB (Circuit Switched Fallback) in 4G  LTE network will be presented. In the CSFB procedure, we found the  authentication step is missing. This results in that an attacker can hijack  the victim's communication. We named this attack as 'Ghost Telephonist'.  Several exploitations can be made based on this vulnerability. When the call  or SMS is not encrypted, or weakly encrypted, the attacker can impersonate  the victim to receive the Mobile Terminated' calls and messages or to  initiate the Mobile Originated' calls and messages. Furthermore, Telephonist  Attack can obtain the victim's phone number and then use the phone number to  make advanced attack, e.g. breaking Internet online accounts. These attacks  can randomly choose victims, or target a given victim. We verified these  attack with our own phones in operators' network in a small controllable  scale. The experiments proved the vulnerability really exists. The attack  doesn't need fake base station so the attack cost is low. The victim doesn't  sense being attacked since no fake base station and no cell re-selection. Now  we are collaborating with operators and terminal manufactures to fix this  vulnerability.",

   "description" : "Most forms of WPA2-EAP have been broken for nearly a decade.  EAP-TTLS and EAP-PEAP have long been susceptible to evil twin attacks, yet  most enterprise organizations still rely on these technologies to secure  their wireless infrastructure. The reason for this is that the secure  alternative, EAP-TLS, is notoriously arduous to implement. To compensate for  the weak perimeter security provided by EAP-TTLS and EAP-PEAP, many  organizations use port based NAC appliances to prevent attackers from  pivoting further into the network after the wireless has been breached. This  solution is thought to provide an acceptable balance between security and  accessibility. The problem with this approach is that it assumes that EAP is  exclusively a perimeter defense mechanism. In this presentation, we will  present a novel type of rogue access point attack that can be used to bypass  port-based access control mechanisms in wireless networks. In doing so, we  will challenge the assumption that reactive approaches to wireless security  are an acceptable alternative to strong physical layer protections such as  WPA2-EAP using EAP-TLS.  ",

It should come as no surprise that those sources are fairly limited  and somewhat outdates.     The presentation then moves on to try and collect some data ourselves. This  is done by actively investigating and auditting. Code review, fuzzing,  runtime testing on all 3 major BSD distributions [NetBSD/OpenBSD/FreeBSD].  This is done by first investigating what would be good places where the bugs  might be. Once determined, a detailed review is performed of these places.  Samples and demos will be shown.     I end the presentation with  some results and conclusions. I will list what the outcome was in terms of  bugs found, and who -based on the data I now have- among the 3 main BSD  distributions can be seen as the clear winner and loser. I will go into  detail about the code quality observed and give some pointers on how to  improve some code.

   "description" : "The second half of 2016 saw the rise of a new generation of  IoT botnets consisting of webcams and other IoT devices. These botnets were  then subsequently used to launch DDoS attacks on an unprecedented scale  against Olympic-affiliated organizations, OVH, the web site of Brian Krebs  and Dyn.    Early 2017, a multi-stage Windows Trojan containing code to scan for  vulnerable IoT devices and inject them with Mirai bot code was discovered.  The number of IoT devices which were previously safely hidden inside  corporate perimeters, vastly exceeds those directly accessible from the  Internet, allowing for the creation of botnets with unprecedented reach and  scale.     This reveals an evolution in the threat  landscape that most organizations are completely unprepared to deal with and  will require a fundamental shift in how we defend against DDoS attacks.    This presentation will include:  - An analysis of the Windows Mirai seeder including  its design, history, infection vectors and potential evolution.  - The DDoS capabilities of typically infected IoT devices including  malicious traffic analysis.  - The consequences of infected IoT devices inside the corporate network  including the impact of DDoS attacks, originating from the inside, targeting  corporate assets and external resources.  - How to detect, classify and mitigate this new threat.",

   "description" : "The human genome is, fundamentally, a complex open-source  digital operating system (and set of application programs) built on the  digital molecules DNA and RNA.     The genome has thousands of publicly documented, unpatchable security  vulnerabilities, previously called \"genetic diseases.\" Because  emerging DNA/RNA technologies, including CRISPR-Cas9 and especially those  arising from the Cancer Moonshot program, will create straightforward methods  to digitally reprogram the genome in free-living humans, malicious  exploitation of genomic vulnerabilities will soon be possible on a wide  scale.     This presentation shows the breathtaking potential for such hacks, most  notably the exquisite targeting precision that the genome supports -- in  effect, population, and time -- spanning annoyance to organized crime to  civilization-ending pandemics far worse than Ebola.     Because humans are poor at responding to less-than-immediate threats, and  because there is no marketplace demand for defensive technologies on the  DNA/RNA platform, the hacker community has an important role to play in  devising thought-experiments to convince policy makers to initiate defensive  works, before offensive hacks can be deployed in the wild. Hackers can  literally save the world... from ourselves.",

   "description" : "On April 16 2016, an army of bots stormed upon Wix servers,  creating new accounts and publishing shady websites in mass. The attack was  carried by a malicious Chrome extension, installed on tens of thousands of  devices, sending HTTP requests simultaneously. This Extension Bot has used  Wix websites platform and Facebook messaging service, to distribute itself  among users. Two months later, same attackers strike again. This time they  used infectious notifications, popping up on Facebook and leading to a  malicious Windows-runnable JSE file. Upon clicking, the file ran and  installed a Chrome extension on the victim's browser. Then the extension used  Facebook messaging once again to pass itself on to more victims.    Analyzing these attacks, we were  amazed by the highly elusive nature of these bots, especially when it comes  to bypassing web-based bot-detection systems.  This shouldn't be surprising, since legit browser extensions are supposed to  send Facebook messages, create Wix websites, or in fact perform any action on  behalf of the user.    On the other hand, smuggling a malicious extension into Google Web Store and  distributing it among victims efficiently, like these attackers did, is let's  say - not a stroll in the park.  But don't worry, there are other options.    Recently, several popular Chrome extensions were found to be vulnerable to  XSS. Yep, the same old XSS every rookie finds in so many web applications. So  browser extensions suffer from it too, and sadly, in their case it can be  much deadlier than in regular websites.  One noticeable example is the Adobe Acrobat Chrome extension, which was  silently installed on January 10 by Adobe, on an insane number of 30 million  devices. A DOM-based XSS vulnerability in the extension (found by Google  Project Zero) allowed an attacker to craft a content that would run  Javascript as the extension.    In this talk I will show how such a flaw leads to full and permanent control  over the victim's browser, turning the extension into zombie.  Additionally, Shedding more light on the 2016 attacks on Wix and Facebook  described in the beginning, I will demonstrate how an attacker can use  similar techniques to distribute her malicious payload efficiently on to new  victims, through popular social platforms - creating the web's most powerful  botnet ever.",

   "description" : "Security experts recommend using different, complex passwords  for individual services, but everybody knows the issue arising from this  approach: It is impossible to keep all the complex passwords in mind. One  solution to this issue are password managers, which aim to provide a secure,  centralized storage for credentials. The rise of mobile password managers  even allows the user to carry their credentials in their pocket, providing  instant access to these credentials if required. This advantage can immediately  turn into a disadvantage as all credentials are stored in one central  location. What happens if your device gets lost, stolen or a hacker gets  access to your device? Are your personal secrets and credentials secure?  We say no! In our recent analysis  of well-known Android password manager apps, amongst them are vendors such as  LastPass, Dashlane, 1Password, Avast, and several others, we aimed to bypass  their security by either stealing the master password or by directly  accessing the stored credentials. Implementation flaws resulted in severe  security vulnerabilities. In all of those cases, no root permissions were  required for a successful attack. We will explain our attacks in detail. We  will also propose possible security fixes and recommendations on how to avoid  the vulnerabilities.",

   "description" : "Prior research detailing the relationship between malware,  bulletproof hosting, and SSL gave researchers methods to investigate SSL data  only if given a set of seed domains.  We present a novel statistical technique that allow us to discover  botnet and bulletproof hosting IP space by examining SSL distribution  patterns from open source data while working with limited or no seed  information. This work can be accomplished using open source datasets and  data tools.    SSL data obtained from scanning the entire IPv4 namespace can be represented  as a series of 4 million node bipartite graphs where a common name is  connected to either an IP/CIDR/ASN via an edge. We use the concept of  relative entropy to create a pairwise distance metric between any two common  names and any two ASNs. The metric allows us to generalize the concept of  regular and anomalous SSL distribution patterns.     Relative entropy is useful  in identifying domains that have anomalous network structures. The domains we  found in this case were related to the Zbot proxy network. The Zbot proxy  network contains a structure similar to popular CDNs like Akamai, Google, etc  but instead rely on compromised devices to relay their data. Through layering  these SSL signals with passive DNS data we create a pipeline that can extract  Zbot domains with high accuracy.",

   "description" : "Attackers, administrators and many legitimate products rely on  PowerShell for their core functionality. However, being a Windows-signed  binary native on Windows 7 and later that enables reflective injection of  binaries and DLLs and memory-resident execution of remotely hosted scripts  has made it increasingly attractive for attackers and commodity malware  authors alike. In environments where PowerShell is heavily used, filtering  out legitimate activity to detect malicious PowerShell usage is not trivial.      A/V signatures applied to command line arguments work sometimes. AMSI-based  (Anti-malware Scanning Interface) detections available in Windows 10 and  PowerShell 5.0 perform significantly better, but obfuscation and evasion  techniques can bypass both detection approaches.     Six months after the release of Invoke-Obfuscation, these obfuscation  techniques continue to bypass A/V signatures and many content matching  detections. In addition, the recent release of Invoke-CradleCrafter has made  detecting remote download cradle syntaxes much more difficult.     The excellent logging available in PowerShell 5.0 (not  to mention the many security features baked into PowerShell 5.0) is the key  to detecting existing and future obfuscation techniques. However, PowerShell  5.0 logging produces a substantial amount of logs, which is great for SIEM  salespeople but not ideal for your security budget.       Revoke-Obfuscation is a PowerShell framework to help detect obfuscated  PowerShell commands and scripts by applying a suite of unique statistical  analysis, character distribution and command invocation checks against any  arbitrary PowerShell command or script. It works with PowerShell .evtx files,  command lines, scripts, ScriptBlock logs, Module logs, and allows for the  easy addition of new custom indicators.     Approaches for evading these detection techniques will be discussed and  demonstrated.     Revoke-Obfuscation has been used  in numerous Mandiant investigations to successfully identify obfuscated and  non-obfuscated malicious PowerShell scripts and commands. It also detects all  obfuscation techniques in Invoke-Obfuscation, including two new techniques  being released with this presentation.",

   "description" : "The typical security professional is largely unfamiliar with  the Windows named pipes interface, or considers it to be an internal-only  communication interface.   As a result, open RPC (135) or SMB (445) ports are typically considered  potentially entry points in \"infrastructure\" penetration  tests.    However, named pipes can in fact be used as an application-level entry  vector for well known attacks such as buffer overflow, denial of service or  even code injection attacks and XML bombs, depending on the nature of  listening service to the specific pipe on the target machine.    As it turns out, it seems that many popular and widely used Microsoft  Windows-based enterprise applications open a large number of named pipes on  each endpoint or server on which they are deployed, significantly increase an  environments attack surface without the organization or end user being aware  of the risk.   Since there's a complete lack of awareness to the entry point, there's very limited  options available to organizations to mitigate it, making it a perfect attack  target for the sophisticated attacker.    In this presentation we will highlight how named pipes have become a  neglected and forgotten external interface. We will show some tools that can  help find vulnerable named pipes, discuss the mitigations, and demonstrate  the exploitation process on a vulnerable interface.",

   "description" : "2016 was the year of Java deserialization apocalypse. Although  Java Deserialization attacks were known for years, the publication of the  Apache Commons Collection Remote Code Execution (RCE from now on) gadget  finally brought this forgotten vulnerability to the spotlight and motivated  the community to start finding and fixing these issues.  One of the most suggested solutions for avoiding Java deserialization issues  was to move away from Java Deserialization altogether and use safer formats  such as JSON. In this talk, we will analyze the most popular JSON parsers in  both .NET and Java for potential RCE vectors.  We will demonstrate that RCE is also possible in these libraries and present  details about the ones that are vulnerable to RCE by default. We will also  discuss common configurations that make other libraries vulnerable.  In addition to focusing on JSON format, we will generalize the attack  techniques to other serialization formats. In particular, we will pay close  attention to several serialization formats in .NET. These formats have also  been known to be vulnerable since 2012 but the lack of known RCE gadgets led  some software vendors to not take this issue seriously. We hope this talk  will change this. With the intention of bringing the due attention to this  vulnerability class in .NET, we will review the known vulnerable formats,  present other formats which we found to be vulnerable as well and conclude  presenting several gadgets from system libraries that may be used to achieve  RCE in a stable way: no memory corruption -- just simple process  invocation.  Finally, we will provide recommendations on how to determine if your code is  vulnerable, provide remediation advice, and discuss alternative approaches.",

   "description" : "Throughout history, humans have built tools in an attempt to  solve problems and avoid doing work. Computers came about as a result of this  laziness, and promptly created a host of new problems in the form of (among  other things) software bugs and vulnerabilities. Naturally, humans  immediately started to think of ways to build tools to find and fix them, and  the modern security cycle was born.    The culmination of this push, thus far, is last year's DARPA Cyber Grand  Challenge, a competition in which completely automated systems found,  exploited, and patched software vulnerabilities. But looking at the CGC from  the outside is misleading: one sees huge racks of servers battling it out on  stage, but doesn't see the program analysis methods used, the subtle  trade-offs accepted, and the real capabilities and limitations of these  systems. One also doesn't see why, outside of the controlled CGC environment,  automated techniques don't actually scale to the analysis of real-world  software!    This talk will provide a better vantage point. On the 25th anniversary of  DEF CON , we will go through these  last 25 years of program analysis. We'll learn about the different  disciplines of program analysis, understand the strength and drawbacks of  each, and see if, and to what extend, they are used in the course of actual  vulnerability analysis. We'll understand the insights of static analysis, the  brilliance of symbolic execution, the simple elegance of dynamic analysis,  and the flaws of each.    Did you know that every finalist system in the Cyber Grand Challenge used a  combination of dynamic analysis and symbolic execution to find  vulnerabilities, but used static analysis to patch them? Why is that? Did you  know that, to make the contest feasible for modern program analysis  techniques, the CGC enforced a drastically-simplified OS model? What does  this mean for you, if you want to use program analysis while finding vulns  and collecting bug bounties? Come to this talk and become an expert, and  maybe go on to contribute to the future of program analysis!  ",
