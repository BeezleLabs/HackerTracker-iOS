Furthermore, browsers are protecting us from more-and-more attacks, but what are all of these acronyms? SOP, CSP, XSS, HSTS, HPKP, CAA… at the end of the day, we just want useable AND secure applications. This talk will break down exactly what all of these acronyms and browser-enforced security policies mean. Attendees will learn implementation and long-term strategies in effort to increase security posture without potentially sinkholing your user’s traffic. Whether you’re a first time developer, multi-linguist application guru, or simply an app user who wants to know what all of this security fuss is about – this session will appeal to the entire security conscious gamut.",

In order for pentesters and red teamers to remain effective in analyzing security risks, they must adapt techniques in a way that brings value to the customer.\n\nIn this presentation we will begin by demonstrating adaptive techniques to crack the perimeter of Google Suite customers. Next, we will show how evasion can be accomplished by hiding in plain-sight due to failures in incident response plans. Finally, we will also show how a simple compromise could mean collateral damage for customers who are not carefully monitoring these cloud environments.",

This includes PLC design and operation and why things are they way they are today in ICS network environments.  It also includes basic information on how to identify ABB, Honeywell, Emerson, Telvent, Siemens, Rockwell and BACNet network connections.  It also explains in great detail, the Modbus and DNP3 protocols and how to manually decode them.  The second section has three labs which take the student through decoding the Modbus protocol, detailed Wireshark analysis techniques and then running an automated NSM tool.\n\nSee link for more details.",

			"description": "For the first time BSides Orlando will run a Hands On Hall sponsored by Black Hills Information Security. This will include live demos where attendees have the opportunity to “get their hands dirty” with short labs.\n\nBlack Hills Information Security is excited to bring some of the popular Wild West Hacking labs to BSides Orlando 2018. What? You haven’t heard about the WWHF labs? Well then are you in for a treat! The labs are totally hands on, with detailed instructions and a BHIS researcher to help if you get stuck . You will have the opportunity to do the following:\n\nInteract with a Jatagulator to perform reconnaissance on a device or communicate with their embedded chips.\nUse a Bus Pirate to dump the firmware and obtain gold from a wireless router chip.\nPlay with Software Defined Radio (SDR) and perform replay attacks against common technologies.\n\nIf you have not heard of the words: Jatagulator, Bus Pirate or SDR then you must join BHIS in their playground. Hope to see you there!\n\nLearn more about Black Hills Information Security here: https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/\n\nCheck out Wild West Hackin’ Fest: https://www.wildwesthackinfest.com/",
