      "description": "Adware isn’t a new or an exciting threat. It is often ignored by security professionals because “they just display ads.” Security companies often classify adware as “PuPs” of “Potentially unwanted programs,” downplaying their actual risks and dangers. In this talk I demonstrate just how serious adware can be and how the only difference between adware and malware is the fact that adware companies have legal departments. This is the talk that adware makers don’t want you to attend.\n\nBack in 2016 I discovered a new OSX strain of the Pirrit adware/malware which, at the time, only targeted Windows machines. I completely reverse engineered the malware; it runs with root privileges, hijacks all HTTP traffic on the infected machine, and employs several other nefarious tricks. Due to some stunning opsec mistakes I found the malware’s authors full names and the company that they work for. Fast forward to the present, OSX/Pirrit was back with a vengeance, employing new techniques and learning their lessons from everything I wrote about in my previous reports and talks. Nevertheless, after lots of binary reverse engineering, going through thousands of lines of JavaScript, bash, and AppleScript code - I managed to reveal just how sinister the new version of OSX/pirrit is which is virtually impossible to remove without deep OSX knowledge. Due to more opsec mistakes by the authors I managed to tie this new wave of infections back to On top of that, TargetingEdge, the company who makes this adware/malware, bombarded us with cease and desist letters, threatening my employer and myself personally to prevent us from publishing our report.\n\nThis talk will highlight all of the methods used by the malware authors to abuse systems, I will guide the attendees through the process of reverse engineering such malware and share with everyone the amazing and hilarious story behind this whole incident. There will be IDA screenshots, there will be stunning opsec mistakes by the authors and there will lolz galore.",

      "description": "The idea for this talk came from several clients asking the same basic legal questions about security research and what they can and shouldn’t do to avoid criminal liability. I thought this would be a good forum to try to answer these questions, especially for private and independent researchers who do not have the backing of a large firm behind them. We’re going to try to answer a couple of generic legal questions that affects anyone who performs security research. Where’s the line in the sand regarding what a security researcher can do and shouldn’t do to avoid criminal liability, and what happens if it’s crossed? What happens when a security researcher wants to disclose a vulnerability to the manufacturer? Can that manufacturer sue the researcher to stop them from publishing their research or giving talks, and can the manufacturer sue for compensatory damages (i.e. money)?",

      "description": "Although not commonly known, HTTP2 was first published in May 2015 as an update to HTTP 1.1. By the end of that year, the majority of major browsers added HTTP2 support and it is now being utilized all across the Internet. Sites such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, and perhaps even your company’s site have HTTP2 enabled. If so, you probably do not realize you are using it. In fact, many Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) are not keeping pace with HTTP2 security needs and common AppSec testing tools such Burp, Zap, and other DAST products don’t support HTTP2.\n\nThis talk will discuss the details of the presenter’s discovery process in identifying how many site hosts are utilizing HTTP2, and a sample of common vulnerabilities which were found on these sites. Attendees will come away with having a better understanding of the security implications of HTTP2 and how you can detect these potential pitfalls on your network using freely available tools.",

But what about in the world of information security? This talk will cover the acronym soup of current communication systems including LoRA, RFM, Satellite, ASK, and many others to identify what protocols make sense when you are trying to communicate either stealthily or in remote areas. In addition, this talk will cover how to improve reliability of wireless communication and the costs associated with making your super pen test box. The aim for this talk is to be interactive, and allow people to share experiences.",

Recent developments have made secure wireless protocols more common, but the fact is there’s still a swarm of simpler RF controls in the wireless world around us. Luckily, the onset of Software Defined Radios (SDRs) means analyzing these insecure signals is easier than ever! We’ll explore the basics of capturing and reversing simple RF control signals with the affordable RTL-SDR. With a little exploration through this menagerie of signals, we can unravel the mysteries of their operation and better understand what risk they pose to the environments we protect.",

      "description": "Have you ever wanted to learn more about how payments work? Do you want to know how criminals bypass security mechanisms on Point of Sales terminals, ATM’s and digital wallets? Payment technologies are a transparent part of our lives. They enable us pay for everything from a coffee to a car. In the first part of this talk we take a look at payment technologies past, present and future. Learn how payments have evolved and what transactions look like today. Next we’ll dive into the different attacks that are possible with each transaction type and discuss which areas security teams should be focused on now, and in the future. Learn how hackers gain access to banking endpoints, bypass fraud mechanisms, and how they ultimately cash out.\n\nPayment methods have changed vastly in the last 50 years. From the development of the ATM to the more recent adoption of digital payment methods. These days it’s hard to find a shop, restaurant or café that doesn’t accept card or contactless payments. In this talk firstly, we will demystify payment methods so that anyone can understand. What is NFC? EMV? and Tokenization? This talk will leave you with a great understanding of how payments work.\n\nIn the second part of this talk we will cover demonstrations of the risks associated with payments. If you considering integrating payment technologies into your business, or already accept payments, pay close attention. Working from case studies and our own experience, we’ll dive into the different attacks that are possible with each transaction type. We’ll look at techniques used to gain access to endpoints such as ATM’s and POS’s. Next we’ll explore the tactics used to bypass fraud detection mechanisms, and the multipliers employed by attackers to make the payout huge.",

This talk will explore some common misconceptions about privacy and contrast behaviors that suggest that either we don’t really know or we don’t actually care about protecting our privacy in real life. We will explore some of the challenges related to achieving and maintaining various degrees of personal privacy in the modern world. We will examine technical issues, as well as, some of the laws and pending legislation impacting it and compare what is happening in the US verses other countries to learn which are doing a better or worse job at protecting their citizen’s personal information. Finally, we will identify current trends and activities that may help or hinder our rights in the near future. We will attempt to discover what is really needed to make our dreams of individual privacy protection come true.",
