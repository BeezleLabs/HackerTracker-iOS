<h2 class="talkTitle">Quantum Computers vs. Computers Security</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Jean-Philippe Aumasson <span class="speakerTitle">Principal Cryptographer, Kudelski Security, Switzerland</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">We've heard about hypothetical quantum computers breaking most of the public-key crypto in use—RSA, elliptic curves, etc.—and we've heard about "post-quantum" systems that resist quantum computers.  We also heard about quantum computers' potential to solve other problems considerably faster than classical computers, such as discrete optimization, machine learning, or code verification problems. And we heard about a commercial quantum computer, and we heard vendors of quantum key distribution or quantum random number generators promise us security as solid as the laws of physics. Still, most of us are clueless regarding:</p>

<ul class="talkList">
<li> How quantum computers work and why they could solve certain problems
  faster than classical computers?
<li> What are the actual facts and what is FUD, hype, or journalistic
  exaggeration?
<li> Could quantum computers help in defending classical computers and
  networks against intrusions?
<li> Is it worth spending money in post-quantum systems, quantum key
  distribution, or in purchasing or developing of a quantum computer? 
<li> Will usable quantum computers be built in the foreseeable future?
</ul>

 <p class="abstract">This talk gives honest answers to those questions, based on the latest research, on analyses of the researchers' and vendors' claims, and on a cost-benefit-risk analyses. We'll expose the fundamental principles of quantum computing in a way comprehensible by anyone, and  we'll skip the technical details that require math and physics knowledge. Yet after this talk you'll best be able to assess the risk of quantum computers, to debunk misleading claims, and to ask the right questions.</p>

 <p class="speakerBio"><strong>Jean-Philippe (JP) Aumasson</strong> is Principal Cryptographer at Kudelski Security, in Switzerland.

<h2 class="talkTitle">Exploring Layer 2 Network Security in Virtualized Environments</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Ronny L. Bull <span class="speakerTitle">Ph.D. Graduate Student, Clarkson University</span></h3>
<h3 class="speaker">Jeanna N. Matthews <span class="speakerTitle">Associate Professor, Clarkson University</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">Cloud service providers offer their customers the ability to deploy virtual machines in a multi-tenant environment. These virtual machines are typically connected to the physical network via a virtualized network configuration. This could be as simple as a bridged interface to each virtual machine or as complicated as a virtual switch providing more robust networking features such as VLANs, QoS, and monitoring. In this paper, we explore whether Layer 2 network attacks that work on physical switches apply to their virtualized counterparts by performing a systematic study across four major hypervisor environments - Open vSwitch, Citrix XenServer, Microsoft Hyper-V Server and VMware vSphere - in seven different virtual networking configurations. First, we use a malicious virtual machine to run a MAC flooding attack and evaluate the impact on co-resident VMs. We find that network performance is degraded on all platforms and that it is possible to eavesdrop on other client traffic passing over the same virtual network for Open vSwitch and Citrix XenServer. Second, we use a malicious virtual machine to run a rogue DHCP server and then run multiple DHCP attack scenarios. On all four platforms, co-resident VMs can be manipulated by providing them with incorrect or malicious network information.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Mr. Bull</strong> is a Computer Science Ph.D. graduate student at Clarkson University focusing on Layer 2 network security in virtualized environments. He presented his preliminary research involving MAC flooding attacks against virtualized networks at the DerbyCon 4.0 computer security conference held in Louisville, KY in September 2014. Mr. Bull earned an A.A.S. degree in Computer Networking at Herkimer College in 2006 and completed both a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science at the State University of New York Institute of Technology in 2011.  He is a full time Lecturer for the School of Engineering at SUNY Polytechnic Institute in Utica, NY teaching undergraduate and graduate courses in both the Network and Computer Security and Telecommunications programs, and also serves as an advisor to the SUNY Poly Network and Computer Security club. Mr. Bull also co-founded and is one of the primary organizers of the Central New York Intercollegiate Hackathon event which brings together local cyber security students from colleges in Central New York to compete against each other in offensive and defensive cyber security activities.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Dr. Matthews</strong> serves as an advisor to Mr. Bull during the course of his research. She is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Clarkson University. Her research interests include virtualization, cloud computing, computer security, computer networks and operating systems. Jeanna received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California at Berkeley in 1999 and her B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science from Ohio State University in 1994. She is currently the chair of the ACM Special Interest Group on Operating Systems (SIGOPS), the editor of ACM Operating System Review and a member of the Executive Committee of US-ACM, the U.S. Public Policy Committee of ACM. She has written several popular books including ”Running Xen: A Hands-On Guide to the Art of Virtualization” and ”Computer Networking: Internet Protocols</p>

  <h2 class="talkTitle">Switches Get Stitches</h2>
  <h3 class="speaker">Colin Cassidy <span class="speakerTitle">Senior Security Consultant at IOActive</span></h3>
  <h3 class="speaker">Éireann Leverett</h3>
  <h3 class="speaker">Robert M. Lee</h3>
  
  <p class="abstract">This talk will introduce you to Industrial Ethernet Switches and their vulnerabilities. These are switches used in industrial environments, like substations, factories, refineries, ports, or other  homes of industrial automation. In other words: DCS, PCS, ICS & SCADA switches.</p>
  
  <p class="abstract">The researchers focus on attacking the management plane of these switches, because we all know that industrial system protocols lack authentication or cryptographic integrity. Thus, compromising any switch allows the creation of malicious firmwares for further MITM manipulation of a live process.  Such MITM manipulation can lead to the plant or process shutting down (think: nuclear reactor SCRAM) or getting into a unknown and hazardous state (think: damaging a blast furnace at a steel mill)</p>
  
  <p class="abstract">Not only will vulnerabilities be disclosed for the first time, but the methods of finding those vulnerabilities will be shared. All vulnerabilities disclosed will be in the default configuration state of the devices. While these vulnerabilities have been responsibly disclosed to the vendors, SCADA/ICS patching in live environments tends to take 1-3 years.  Because of this patching lag, the researchers will also be providing live mitigations that owner/operators can use immediately to protect themselves. At least four vendors switches will be examined: Siemens, GE, Garrettcom and Opengear.</p>
  
  <p class="speakerBio"><strong>Colin Cassidy</strong> is a security consultant for IOActive where he focuses on Industrial Control Systems. He has a strong development and software engineering background. He is also a seasoned leader in the areas of security and software engineering.  Before joining IOActive, Cassidy served for a number of years as Technical Manager and Security Technical Lead for IGE Energy Services, Ltd, part of GE Energy. He has hands-on experience with PowerOn Fusion, a leading Outage Management System/Distribution Management System (OMS/DMS) solution for electricity distribution management. He also led a team of developers in producing new functionality within the core product and worked with customers to understand their requirements.  Colin Cassidy has a BSc (Hons) in Computing Science from the University of Glasgow.</p>
  
  <p class="speakerBio"><strong>Éireann Leverett</strong> hates writing bios in the third person. He once placed second in an Eireann Leverett impersonation contest. He likes teaching the basics, and learning the obscure. He is sometimes jealous of his own moustache for being more famous than he is. If he could sum up his life in one sentence; he wouldn't. That would be a life-sentence! He is primarily known for smashing the myth of the air-gap in industrial systems with his master's thesis, finding authentication bypasses for industrial ethernet switches, and working with incident response teams to improve their understanding of industrial control systems security. He believes security takes an awful lot more than penetration-testing and speaks often about the wider effects of embedded system insecurity.</p>
  
  <p class="speakerBio"><strong>Robert M. Lee</strong> is a co-founder of Dragos Security LLC where he has a passion for control system protocol analysis, digital forensics, and threat intelligence research. He is also an active-duty U.S. Air Force Cyber Warfare Operations Officer where he has been a member of multiple computer network defense teams including his establishing and leading of a first-of-its-kind ICS/SCADA threat intelligence and intrusion analysis mission. Robert received his BS from the United States Air Force Academy and his MS in Cybersecurity Digital Forensics from Utica College. He is a passionate educator and teaches in the ICS and Forensics programs at SANS and is an Adjunct Lecturer at Utica College where he teaches in their MS Cybersecurity program. Robert is also the author of 'SCADA and Me' and is currently pursuing his PhD at Kings College London with research in control system cyber security. He routinely publishes academic and industry focused works in a wide variety of journals and publications; additionally he has presented at conferences around the world.</p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">Paranoia and ProxyHam: High-Stakes Anonymity on the Internet</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Benjamin Caudill <span class="speakerTitle">Founder, Rhino Security Labs</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">From the US to China and beyond, anonymity on the internet is under fire – particularly for whistleblowers.  National interests are pushing for greater control and monitoring of internet content, often invoking harsh punishments for informers and journalists, if caught.  While a range of technologies (such as ToR) can provide some level of anonymity, a fundamental flaw still exists: a direct relationship between IP address and physical location.  If your true IP is ever uncovered, it’s game over – a significant threat when your adversary owns the infrastructure.</p>

<p class="abstract">To resolve this issue, I present ProxyHam, a hardware device which utilizes both WiFi and the 900Mhz band to act as a hardware proxy, routing local traffic through a far-off wireless network – and significantly increasing the difficulty in identifying the true source of the traffic.  In addition to a demonstration of the device itself, full hardware schematics and code will be made freely available. </p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Benjamin Caudill</strong> is founder and Principal Consultant of Rhino Security Labs, an information security consultancy in Seattle, WA.  As a security professional, Benjamin has broken and secured environments from mobile startups to government agencies and Fortune 500’s.  His security research and exploits have been published in Wired Magazine, CNN, CNET, Forbes and Geekwire, as well as presented at security conferences such as DEF CON 21.</p>

Other file formats allow for similar interactions but are not well-known for allowing such functionality. In this talk, we explore various file formats and their ability to make outbound requests, as well as what that means from a security and privacy perspective. Most interestingly, these techniques are not built on mistakes, but intentional design decisions, meaning that they will not be fixed as bugs. From data loss prevention to de-anonymization to request forgery to NTLM credential capture, this presentation will explore what it means to have files that communicate to various endpoints when opened.</p>

<p class="abstract">Regular Expression Denial of Service has existed for well over a decade, but has not received the love it deserves lately.

  <p class="abstract">The term “Bad USB” has gotten some much needed press in last few months. There have been talks that have identified the risks that are caused by the inherent trust between the OS and any device attached by USB. I found in my research that most of the available payloads for the USB rubber ducky would be stopped by common enterprise security solutions. I then set out to create a new exploit that would force the victim to trust my Man-In-The-Middle access point. After my payload is deployed, all Wi-Fi communications will be readable, including usernames, passwords and authentication cookies. The attack will work without the need of elevating privileges, which makes it ideal for corporate environments.</p>

<p class="abstract">Today's web apps are developed using a mashup of client- and server-side technologies. Everything from sophisticated Javascript libraries to third-party web services are thrown into the mix. Over the years, we've been asked to test these web apps with security tools that haven't evolved at the same pace. A common short-coming in most of these tools is their inability to perform dynamic analysis to identify vulnerabilities such as dynamically rendered XSS or DOM-based XSS. This is where BurpKit comes in - a BurpSuite plugin that integrates the power of WebKit with that of BurpSuite. In this presentation we'll go over how one can leverage WebKit to write their own web pen-testing tools and introduce BurpKit. We'll show you how BurpKit is able to perform a variety of powerful tasks including dynamic analysis, BurpSuite scripting, and more! Best of all, the plugin will be free and open source so you can extended it to your heart's desire!

<h2 class="talkTitle">Hooked Browser Meshed-Networks with WebRTC and BeEF</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Christian (@xntrik) Frichot <span class="speakerTitle">Principal Security Consultant at Asterisk Information Security</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">One of the biggest issues with BeEF is that each hooked browser has to talk to your BeEF server. To try and avoid detection, you often want to try and obfuscate or hide your browsers, particularly if you're heavily targeting a single organization. Don’t worry Internet-friends, those crazy pioneers at Google, Mozilla and Opera have solved this problem for you with the introduction of Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC). Initially designed to allow browsers to stream multimedia to each other, the spec has made its way into most Chrome and Firefox browsers, not to mention it’s enabled by default.

<p class="abstract">Using this bleeding-edge web technology, we can now mesh all those hooked browsers, funnelling all your BeEF comms through a single sacrificial beach-head. Leveraging WebRTC technologies (such as STUN/TURN and even the fact the RTC-enabled browsers on local subnets can simply UDP each other), meshing browsers together can really throw a spanner into an incident-responders work. The possibilities for a browser-attacker are fairly endless, channeling comms through a single browser, or, making all the browsers communicate with each other in round-robin. This is just another tool tucked into your belt to try and initiate and maintain control over browsers.</p>

<p class="abstract">This presentation will present a background into WebRTC, and then demonstrate the WebRTC BeEF extension. (Bloody JavaScript...)</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Christian</strong> is an Australian security professional and founder of Asterisk Information Security based in Perth. He is one of the co-authors of the recently published Browser Hacker’s Handbook (by Wiley), and long-term code-funkerer of the BeEF project.

He has a deep love/hate relationship with web browsers and JavaScript. Christian has presented at numerous Australian security conferences, including OWASP AppSec APAC, the Australian Information Security Association's Perth Con, ISACA's Perth Con, OWASP Melbourne, and Ruxmon.

<p class="abstract">When we lack the capability to understand our tools, we operate at the mercy of those that do. Penetration testers make excellent targets for bad actors, as the average tester’s awareness and understanding of the potential risks and vulnerabilities in their tools and processes is low, and the value of the information they gather and gain access to among their client base is very high. As demonstrated by Wesley’s DEF CON 21 talk on vulnerabilities in penetration testing devices, and last year’s compromise of WiFi Pineapple devices, the tools of offensive security professionals often represent a soft target. In this talk, operational security issues facing penetration testers will be discussed, including communication and data security (not just “bugs”), which impact both testers and clients. A classification system for illustrating the risks of various tools is presented, and vulnerabilities in specific hardware and software use cases are presented. Recommendations are made for improving penetration testing practices and training. This talk is intended to be valuable to penetration testers wanting to protect themselves and their clients, and for those who are interesting in profiling weaknesses of opposing forces that may use similar tools and techniques.</p>

<p class="abstract">Kerberos "Golden Tickets" were unveiled by Alva "Skip" Duckwall &amp; Benjamin Delpy in 2014 during their Black Hat USA presentation. Around this time, Active Directory (AD) admins all over the world felt a great disturbance in the Force. Golden Tickets are the ultimate method for persistent, forever AD admin rights to a network since they are valid Kerberos tickets and can't be detected, right?</p>
 
<p class="abstract">This talk covers the latest Active Directory attack vectors and describes how to detect Golden Ticket usage. Provided are key indicators that can detect Kerberos attacks on your network, including Golden tickets, Silver tickets &amp; MS14-068 exploitation, as well as methods to identify, mitigate, and prevent common Active Directory attack vectors. When forged Kerberos tickets are used in AD, there are some interesting artifacts that can be identified. Yes, despite what you may have read on the internet, there are ways to detect Golden &amp; Silver Ticket usage!</p> 

<p class="abstract">Some of the topics covered:</p>

<ul class="talkList">
<li> How attackers go from zero to (Domain) Admin
<li> MS14-068: the vulnerability, the exploit, and the danger.
<li> "SPN Scanning" with PowerShell to identify potential targets without network scans (SQL, Exchange, FIM, webservers, etc.).
<li> Exploiting weak service account passwords as a regular AD user.
<li> Mimikatz, the attacker's multi-tool.
<li> Using Silver Tickets for stealthy persistence that won’t be detected (until now).
<li> Identifying forged Kerberos tickets (Golden &amp; Silver Tickets) on your network.
<li> Detecting offensive PowerShell tools like Invoke-Mimikatz.
<li> Active Directory attack mitigation.

<p class="abstract">Although the hacking of automobiles is a topic often discussed, details regarding successful attacks, if ever made public, are non-comprehensive at best.  The ambiguous nature of automotive security leads to narratives that are polar opposites: either we’re all going to die or our cars are perfectly safe.  In this talk, we will show the reality of car hacking by demonstrating exactly how a remote attack works against an unaltered, factory vehicle.  Starting with remote exploitation, we will show how to pivot through different pieces of the vehicle’s hardware in order to be able to send messages on the CAN bus to critical electronic control units.  We will conclude by showing several CAN messages that affect physical systems of the vehicle.  By chaining these elements together, we will demonstrate the reality and limitations of remote car attacks.</p>

  <h2 class="talkTitle">Spread Spectrum Satcom Hacking: Attacking The GlobalStar</h2> 
  <h3 class="speaker">Colby Moore <span class="speakerTitle">Manager of Special Activities, Synack</span></h3>
  
  
  <p class="abstract">Recently there have been several highly publicized talks about satellite hacking. However, most only touch on the theoretical rather than demonstrate actual vulnerabilities and real world attack scenarios. This talk will demystify some of the technologies behind satellite communications and do what no one has done before - take the audience step-by-step from reverse engineering to exploitation of the GlobalStar simplex satcom protocol and demonstrate a full blown signals intelligence collection and spoofing capability. I will also demonstrate how an attacker might simulate critical conditions in satellite connected SCADA systems.</p>
  
  <p class="abstract">In recent years, Globalstar has gained popularity with the introduction of its consumer focused SPOT asset-tracking solutions. During the session, I’ll deconstruct the transmitters used in these (and commercial) solutions and reveal design and implementation flaws that result in the ability to intercept, spoof, falsify, and intelligently jam communications. Due to design tradeoffs these vulnerabilities are realistically unpatchable and put millions of devices, critical infrastructure, emergency services, and high value assets at risk.</p>  
  
  <p class="speakerBio"><strong>Colby Moore</strong> is Synack's Manager of Special Activities.  He works on the oddball and difficult problems that no one else knows how to tackle and strives to embrace the attacker mindset during all engagements. He is a former employee of VRL and has identified countless 0day vulnerabilities in embedded systems and major applications.  In his spare time you will find him focusing on that sweet spot where hardware and software meet, usually resulting in very interesting consequences.</p>

  <h3 class="speaker">Mahdi Namazifar <span class="speakerTitle">Senior Data Scientist, Talos Team, Cisco Systems</span></h3>
  
  
  <p class="abstract">Numerous botnets employ domain generation algorithms (DGA) to dynamically generate a large number of random domain names from which a small subset is selected for their command and control.  A vast majority of DGA algorithms create random sequences of characters.  In this work we present a novel language-based technique for detecting domain names that are generate by chaining random characters.  To evaluate randomness of a given string (domain name) we lookup substrings of the string in the dictionary that we’ve built for this technique, and then we calculate a randomness score for the string based on several different factors including length of the string, number of languages that cover the substrings, etc.  This score is used for determining whether the given string is a random sequence of characters. In order to evaluate the performance of this technique, on the one hand we use 9 known DGA algorithms to create random domain names as DGA domains, and on the other hand we use domain names from the Alexa 10,000 as likely non-DGA domains.  The results show that our technique is more than 99% accurate in detecting random and non-random domain names.</p>

  <p class="abstract">Hello, Mr. Anderson. You may think that the senses we are born with are all we have to work with. Sure, we have cochlear and retinal implants, but those only work because we know how ears and eyes work, right? Wrong. As of 2015, we are now on the cusp of developing the capabilities to augment the realities in which we are immersed. Join me, as I discuss my PhD work that concerns not only how this is enabled, but how this can be performed in a rigorous and non-invasive manner with current technology.</p>
  
  <p class="speakerBio">At the time of writing this, <strong>Great Scott (Scott Novich)</strong>, is a finishing PhD student in the department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Rice University, and the department of Neuroscience at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, TX. By the time he gives this talk (with any luck), you can refer to him as "Dr. No." His thesis work under Dr. David Eagleman (author of "Sum," "Incognito," and host and creator of the upcoming PBS television series "The Brain"), surrounds the creation of a framework for developing sensory augmentation devices. The driving application that motivates this framework is his work on a fully real-time sound-to-touch sensory substitution device that is capable of giving deaf individuals a sense of audition that is good enough for perceiving speech. Outside of his daring academic life, he has recently spun out a company from his research with his advisor co-founder, and is a DEF CON goon, and some other stuff.</p>

<h3 class="speaker">Colin O'Flynn <span class="speakerTitle">Dalhousie University</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">If you thought the security practices of regular software was bad, just wait until you start learning about the security of embedded hardware systems. Recent open-source hardware tools have made this field accessible to a wider range of researchers, and this presentation will show you how to perform these attacks for equipment costing $200.</p>

<p class="abstract">Attacks against a variety of real systems will be presented: AES-256 bootloaders, internet of things devices, hardware crypto tokens, and more. All of the attacks can be replicated by the attendees, using either their own tools if such equipped (such as oscilloscopes and pulse generators), the open-hardware ChipWhisperer-Lite, or an FPGA board of their own design.</p>

<p class="abstract">The hands-on nature of this talk is designed to introduce you to the field, and give you the confidence to pick up some online tutorials or books and work through them. Even if you've never tried hardware hacking before, the availability of open-source hardware makes it possible to follow published tutorials and learn all about side-channel power analysis and glitching attacks for yourself.</p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">Advances in Linux Process Forensics Using ECFS</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Ryan O'Neill <span class="speakerTitle">Security Consultant, Leviathan Security Group</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">Many hackers today are using process memory infections to maintain stealth residence inside of a compromised system. The current state of forensics tools in Linux, lack the sophistication used by the infection methods found in real world hacks. ECFS (Extended core file snapshot) technology, https://github.com/elfmaster/ecfs is an innovative extension to regular ELF core files, designed to be used as forensics-friendly snapshots of process memory. A brief showcasing of the ECFS technology was featured in POC||GTFO 0x7 (Innovations with core files).</p>

<p>However this talk will reveal deeper insight on the many features of this technology, such as full symbol table reconstruction, builtin detection heuristics, and how common binutils such as objdump, and readelf can be used to quickly identify complex infections such as PLT/GOT hooks and shared library injection. We will also cover the libecfs API that was created specifically for malware and forensics analysts who aim to implement support for ECFS snapshots into new or existing malware detection software.</p> 

<p>While the ECFS core format was initially designed for runtime malware and forensics purposes, another very neat aspect to this technology was quickly extrapolated on; the ECFS snapshots can also be reloaded into memory and executed. Very similar to VM snapshots, which opens many more doors for research and exploration in a vast array of areas from dynamic analysis to migrating live processes across systems. ECFS is still a work in progress, but for those who understand the arduous nature of dissecting a process and identifying anomalies, will surely acquire a quick respect for the new technology that makes all of this so much easier.</p>

  <h3 class="speaker">Gregory Pickett <span class="speakerTitle">Cybersecurity Operations, Hellfire Security</span></h3>
  
  
  <p class="abstract">The Open Network Install Environment, or ONIE, makes commodity or WhiteBox Ethernet possible.  By placing a common, Linux-based, install environment onto the firmware of the switch, customers can deploy the Network Operating Systems of their choice onto the switch and do so whenever they like without replacing the hardware.  The problem is, if this gets compromised, it also makes it possible for hackers to install malware onto the switch.  Malware that can manipulate it and your network, and keep doing it long after a Network Operating System reinstall.</p>
  
  <p class="abstract">With no secure boot, no encryption, no authentication, predictable HTTP/TFTP waterfalls, and exposed post-installation partition, ONIE is very susceptible to compromise.  And with Network Operating Systems such as Switch Light, Cumulus Linux, and Mellanox-OS via their agents Indigo, Puppet, and eSwitchd not exactly putting up a fight with problems like no authentication, no encryption, poor encryption, and insufficient isolation, this is a real possibility.</p>
  
  <p class="abstract">In this session, we'll cover the weaknesses in ONIE, ways to reach the platform through these Network Operating Systems, and what can happen if we don't properly protect the Control Plane these switches run on.  I'll even demonstrate with a drive-by web-attack that is able to pivot through a Windows management station to reach the isolated control plane network, and infect one of these ONIE-based switches with malware, malware that's there even after a refresh.  You'll even get the source code to take home with you to see how easily it's done.  Finally, we'll talk about how to compensate for these issues so that your network doesn't become infected with and manipulated by this sort of persistent firmware-level malware.</p>

<h3 class="speaker">Chris John Rock <span class="speakerTitle">Kustodian Pty Ltd</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">No one likes to talk about death because it reminds us of our own mortality. When a loved one dies, a formalised process that has been around for hundreds of years is put into the action that calls on Doctors, Coroners, Funeral Directors and the Governments Births Deaths and Registration process. This process is changing with the Internet and doing so is creating vulnerabilities for abuse.</p>
 
<p class="abstract">This presentation focuses on the lack of security controls that allows any of us to virtually kill off our bosses, our parents, husbands or wives, girlfriends, neighbours or investigating police officers and profit from the experience. Forget the blood and guts “”Dexter’’ way of killing someone but focussing in on the digital aspects and the paperwork required when someone dies. How to fill in a Doctors Medical Cause of Death. How to become a Funeral Director. How to bulk upload your chosen victims to kill off to the government to obtain a Death Certificate. How to take their property, close down their bank accounts.</p>
 
<p class="abstract">The presentation wouldn’t be completed if we didn’t talk about births as well. We will investigate the birth registration process and the security vulnerabilities. “The baby harvest” is the concept of making, birth and raising virtual babies to harvest their identities when they are adults. They will be killed using the process above when they are of age and harvest their finances. The technique is based on a shelf company. A shelf company is used by criminals or terrorists who pay all their fees and file incorporation papers annually. They then they put them on the shelf for years, sometimes decades. They pay the minimum corporate tax, build up a credit rating, and comply with filings to create an established, creditworthy business that can be used to launder all kinds of transactions. The Shelf babies will follow the same concept. They will be born, registered with the government open bank accounts, get home loans and life insurance. They will be married to other virtual adults, get passports and when they are ready for harvest they will be killed off for their finance, life insurance or passports to other nations. This is a long range technique spanning decades that will be the next big thing in terrorist financing and criminal money laundering in the future.</p>

Our computers and devices use time in a wide variety of ways such as cache expiration, scheduling tasks or even security technologies. Some of those technologies completely relies on the local clock, and they can be affected by a clock misconfiguration.</p>
  
  <p class="abstract">However, since most operating system providers do not offer secure time synchronisation protocols by default, an attacker could manipulate those protocols and control the local clock.

  <h2 class="talkTitle">Shall We Play a Game?</h2>
  <h3 class="speaker">Tamas Szakaly <span class="speakerTitle">Lead security researcher @ PR-Audit Ltd., Hungary</span></h3>
  
  <p class="abstract">Everybody plays games, and a whole lot of people plays computer games. Despite this fact, very few of us, security researchers consider them as interesting targets. Granted, you won't likely be able to directly hack into a big corporate network via game exploits, but you could for example target the people running the company via their favorite games. Or their children's favorite games. Another scenario: you should consider that a hacked game could allow Not So Admirable people access to your internal network - which at first does not seem that big of a deal considering it's "just" a home network, but when you realize all your mobile phones, your TV set, your VOIP phones, your security cameras, and even your smart house sensors and controllers are part of that network, it looks much more scary.</p>
  
  <p class="abstract">Games are also interesting from a technical standpoint too, since they tend to be quite complex. The majority of them have networking, and they process complex data structures (maps, saved games, etc.) which makes them ideal fuzzing targets. But this talk is not about those kind of exploits. Hackers tend to ignore the low hanging fruits in favor of beautiful exploits, but we really shouldn't - bad guys don't care about how sophisticated some exploit is, they only care about the results. This is why I have decided to take a look around and see what's already there in the games that allows access to the gamers' network. Thus this research about how game scripting engines can be abused started.</p>
  
  <p class="abstract">I'll show in this talk that playing on custom game servers and playing community created maps could easily lead to code execution on our machines - more so, in most cases without the need to bypass the operating system's exploit mitigation techniques. My targets include popular games and game engines like CryEngine 3, Dota 2, Garry's Mod, ARMA3 and Digital Combat Simulator. I'll show a wide range of script abuse from a simple direct command execution in an unrestricted scripting environment through brute forcing a security camera via HTTP requests to complex script sandbox escapes.</p>

<p class="abstract">Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) are the subsets of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. HMIs are control panels that provide interfaces for humans to interact with machines and to manage operations of various types of SCADA systems. HMIs have direct access to SCADA databases including critical software programs. The majority of SCADA systems have web-based HMIs that allow the humans to control the SCADA operations remotely through Internet. This talk unveils various flavors of undisclosed vulnerabilities in web-based SCADA HMIs including but not limited to remote or local file inclusions, insecure authentication through clients, weak password hashing mechanisms, firmware discrepancies, hardcoded credentials, insecure web-services, weak cryptographic design, cross-site request forgery, and many others. This talk digs deeper into the design models of various SCADA systems to highlight security deficiencies in the existing SCADA HMI deployments. The research is driven with a motivation to secure SCADA devices and to build more intelligent solutions by hunting vulnerabilities in SCADA HMIs. The vulnerabilities presented in this talk are completely undisclosed and will be revealed for the first time with live demonstrations. </p>

<h3 class="speaker">Nir Valtman <span class="speakerTitle">CISO – Retail, NCR </span></h3>
<h3 class="speaker">Moshe Ferber <span class="speakerTitle">Co-chairman of the board, Cloud Security Alliance Israel </span></h3>

<p class="abstract">Recent hacks to IaaS platforms reveled that we need to master the attack vectors used: Automation and API attack vector, insecure instances and management dashboard with wide capabilities. Those attack vectors are not unique to Cloud Computing but there are magnified due to the cloud characteristics. The fact is that IaaS instance lifecycle is accelerating, nowadays we can find servers that are installed, launched, process data and terminate - all within a range of minutes. This new accelerated lifecycle makes traditional security processes such as periodic patches, vulnerability scanning, hardening, and forensics impossible. In this accelerated lifecycle, there are no maintenance windows for patches or ability to mitigate vulnerability, so the security infrastructure must adapt to new methods. In this new thinking, we require automation of instance security configuration, hardening, monitoring, and termination. Because there are no maintenance windows, Servers must be patched before they boot up, security configuration and hardening procedures should be integrated with server installation and vulnerability scanning and mitigation processes should be automatic.</p>

<p class="abstract">In the presentation, we plan to announce the full version of a new open source tool called "Cloudefigo" and explain how it enables accelerated security lifecycle. We demonstrate how to launch a pre-configured, already patched instance into an encrypted storage environment automatically while evaluating their security and mitigating them automatically if a vulnerability is found. In the live demo, we leverage Amazon Web Services EC2 Cloud-Init scripts and object storage for provisioning automated security configuration, integrating encryption, including secure encryption key repositories for secure server's communication. The result of those techniques is cloud servers that are resilient, automatically configured, with the reduced attack surface.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Nir</strong> is employed at NCR Corporation as the CISO of NCR Retail. Before the acquisition of Retalix by NCR, he was Chief Security Officer of R&D at the company. As part of his previous positions in the last decade, he worked as Chief Security Architect, Senior Technology Consultant, Application Security Consultant, Systems Infrastructure Security Consultant, and a Technological Trainer. While in these positions, Nir was not only consulting, but also performing hands-on activities in various fields, i.e. hardening, penetration testing, and development for personal/internal applications. In addition, Nir is a public speaker (spoke on BlackHat, DEF CON, OWASP, InfoSec etc.) and open source contributor. Among his contributions, he released an open source anti-defacement tool called AntiDef, and wrote a publication about QRbot, an iPhone QR botnet POC he developed.

  <h2 class="talkTitle">Looping Surveillance Cameras through Live Editing of Network Streams</h2>
  <h3 class="speaker">Eric Van Albert <span class="speakerTitle">independent security researcher</span></h3>
  <h3 class="speaker">Zach Banks <span class="speakerTitle">independent security researcher</span></h3>
  
  
  <p class="abstract">This project consists of the hardware and software necessary to hijack wired network communications. The hardware allows an attacker to splice into live network cabling without ever breaking the physical connection. This allows the traffic on the line to be passively tapped and examined. Once the attacker has gained enough knowledge about the data being sent, the device switches to an active tap topology, where data in both directions can be modified on the fly. Through our custom implementation of the network stack, we can accurately mimic the two devices across almost all OSI layers.</p>
  
  <p class="abstract">We have developed several applications for this technology. Most notable is the editing of live video streams to produce a “camera loop,” that is, hijacking the feed from an Ethernet surveillance camera so that the same footage repeats over and over again. More advanced video transformations can be applied if necessary. This attack can be executed and activated with practically no interruption in service, and when deactivated, is completely transparent.</p>
  
  <p class="speakerBio"><strong>Eric</strong> is a recent MIT graduate who spends his days building 3D printers for Formlabs and his nights crawling around places he probably shouldn’t. He has taught seminars on lockpicking and physical security vulnerabilities to various audiences at the Institute, and done a small bit of security consulting work. When he runs out of projects to hack on, he reads the leaked NSA ANT catalog for ideas.</p>
  
  <p class="speakerBio"><strong>Zach</strong> is also a recent MIT graduate with over 0 years of security experience. He’s particularly interested in the security of embedded devices and knots.

  <h2 class="talkTitle">'DLL Hijacking' on OS X? #@%& Yeah!</h2>
  <h3 class="speaker">Patrick Wardle, Director of R&amp;D, Synack</h3>
  
  
  <p class="abstract">OS X is vulnerable to dynamic library hijacking (independent of the user’s $PATH). By abusing various ‘features’ and undocumented aspects of OS X’s dynamic loader, this talk will reveal how attackers can plant specially-crafted dynamic libraries (.dylibs) that will be automatically loaded by vulnerable applications. Thru this attack, adversaries can perform a wide-range of malicious actions including stealthy persistence, process injection, bypassing anti-malware products and even ‘remote’ infections. So, come watch as apps fall and Gatekeeper crumbles (allowing for the execution of malicious unsigned code downloaded from the internet)! And since “sharing is caring” leave with code and tools that can automatically uncover vulnerable apps, generate compatible hijack .dylibs, or warn you if you’ve become a hijack victim.</p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">Confessions of a Professional Cyber Stalker</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Ken Westin <span class="speakerTitle">Sr. Security Analyst with Tripwire Inc.</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">For several years I developed and utilized various technologies and methods to track criminals leading to at least two dozen convictions. In the process of recovering stolen devices, larger crimes would be uncovered including drugs, theft rings, stolen cars, even a violent car jacking. Much of the evidence in these cases would be collected by stolen devices themselves, such as network information, photos captured from laptops and cell phones, but often times there was additional data that would need to be gathered for a conviction. In this presentation I will walk through actual real cases and discuss in depth the technologies used and additional processes I went through utilizing open source data and other methods to target criminals. I will also discuss how these same tools and methods can be used against the innocent and steps users and developers can take to better protect privacy.</p>

<p class="abstract">In this presentation here are a few examples of cases I worked on which I will reveal details of:</p>

<ul class="talkList">
<li> How a theft ring targeting Portland, Oregon schools was unveiled leading to multiple convictions
<li> How I tracked and recovered $9K worth of stolen camera equipment sold multiple times a year after it was stolen based on data extracted from images online
<li> How mobile phones stolen from a wireless store were tracked leading to the arrest of a theft ring, leading to the conviction of six people and the recovery of a stolen car
<li> Embedding of custom designed trojan for thermal imaging devices for theft tracking and export controls
<li> Tracking of a stolen flash drive to a university computer lab and correlation of security camera and student access ID cards
<li> Tracking a stolen laptop across state lines and how I gathered mountains of evidence in another theft ring case
<li> Several other cases….
</ul>

<h2 class="talkTitle">How to Train Your RFID Hacking Tools</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Craig Young <span class="speakerTitle">Security Researcher, Tripwire VERT</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">With insecure low frequency RFID access control badges still in use at businesses around the world and high frequency NFC technology being incorporated into far more consumer products, RFID hacking tools are invaluable for penetration testers and security researchers alike.  Software defined radio has revolutionized this field with powerful devices like Proxmark3 and RFIDler available for a modest price.  3D printing has also presented new opportunities for makers to create custom antennas and cases to fit specific tasks.  While there is a lot of great information out there about how people use these tools, there is relatively little more than source code available for learning how to develop new firmware to equip these devices with purpose-built logic.  This presentation will discuss the overall architecture of the Proxmark3 and RFIDler tools and provide tutorial style examples for enhancing the firmware.  Proxmark3 development will be demonstrated by upgrading the stand-alone mode to support NFC operations.  For the new kid on the block, RFIDler, we will take a look at how to tweak the system for optimal reliability using 3D printing and enhanced diagnostic tools.</p>

  <h2 class="talkTitle">Build a free cellular traffic capture tool with a vxworks based femoto</h2>
  <h3 class="speaker">Yuwei Zheng <span class="speakerTitle">Senior security researcher, Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd.</span></h3>
  <h3 class="speaker">Haoqi Shan <span class="speakerTitle">Wireless/hardware security researcher, Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd.</span></h3>
  
  
  <p class="abstract">In recent years, more and more products, are integrated with cellular modem, such as cars of BMW, Tesla, wearable devices, remote meters, i.e. Internet of things. Through this way, manufactories can offer remote service and develop a lot of attractive functions to make their product more valuable. However, many vulnerabilities have also been introduced into these systems.</p>
  
  <p class="abstract">It puts new questions to black-box penetration testing engineer.  How to capture the SMS command between the cellular modem and the remote server?  How to intercept the data link?</p>
  
  <p class="abstract">Some existing solutions, such as USRP based OpenBTS, commercial product nanoBTS can be used to build a fake base station and capture data traffic. However all of them cannot access the real operator's core network so that they cannot capture real SMS and voice traffic.</p>
  
  <p class="abstract">With the inspiration from social engineering, we got a femto-cell base station from a telecom operator. After a series of hacking and modifications, we built it as a powerful SMS, voice and data link inception tool. Furthermore, not like a fake station, it’s a legal base station and authorized to access the operator’s core network. By this tool, we can conveniently explore vulnerabilities of cellular modem inside products.</p>
