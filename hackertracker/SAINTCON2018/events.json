      "description": "Over the last decade we have seen a rapid rise in virtualization-based tools in which a hypervisor is used to gain insight into the runtime execution of a system. With these advances in introspection techniques, it is no longer a question of whether a hypervisor can be used to peek inside or even manipulate the VMs it executes. Thus, how can we trust that a hypervisor deployed by a cloud provider will respect the privacy of their customers? While there are hardware-based protection mechanisms with the goal of guaranteeing data privacy even in the presence of such an \"introspecting\" hypervisor, there are currently no tools that can check whether the hypervisor is introspecting when it shouldn't. We have developed a software package that analyzes instructions and memory accesses on an unprivileged guest system which has been deployed onto a hypervisor to determine the potential presence (or lack) of introspection. These techniques are developed to examine properties of modern x86 systems, such as cache-based memory access timing and privileged instruction benchmarking to examine the behavior of the hypervisor. Moreover, we have developed timing methods such as thread racing to determine whether a hypervisor is monitoring regions of memory or hooking instructions. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;",

      "description": "Bio:<br><br>Aaron Sherman currently serves as Senior Director of Cyber Threat Intelligence at Braintrace. Bringing nearly 15 years of cyber threat detection and neutralization success for the U.S. government, Sherman most recently held the position as Cyber Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the Washington, DC and Salt Lake City Field Offices. While at the FBI, Sherman responded to and investigated cyber intrusions and data breaches perpetrated by Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors originating from China and elsewhere. Prior to that role, he was a Counterintelligence Special Agent in the US Army, where he conducted intelligence operations to detect, identify and neutralize threats to the United States military. Sherman has successfully led investigations into criminal cyber intrusions, data breaches, denial of service attacks, ransomware, botnets, business email compromise, identity theft, insider threats, dark web criminal services, account takeovers and payment card fraud. As a leading authority on emerging threats, he has implemented new methodologies for targeting and monitoring cybercriminals on the dark and deep web. His efforts have resulted in the detection and disruption of numerous cybercriminal campaigns targeting US organizations.<br>Presentation:<br><br>Business Email Compromises (BEC) continue to plague organizations world-wide, inflicting catastrophic, financial damages. This presentation will be live demo of an actual BEC using the same TTP\u2019s criminal organizations are currently employing to attack their victims. We will dissected each step of the scheme and learn how to identify pre-attack signatures to help detect and defend against an imminent attack. We will explore several tools and methods to conduct incident response to identify the attacker and his/her actions on your system. Of interest, we will explore the previously undocumented Office365 Activities API to access once-undisclosed logs that are incredibly detailed and helpful when conducting BEC incident response. Lastly, we will discuss tips and best practices when coordinating with law enforcement.",

You can forage for fruit and nuts with the other forest creatures, get lost down a spiraling staircase with no end in sight, throwing out idea after idea, Wall of Sheep, Security Shepherd, pulling from your plethora of security buddies to come do a lunch with your staff on why phishing is bad, very very bad! Or\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6you can build a program based on some sound logic and practicality. Not to say having your buddy talk on phishing techniques isn't a good start, but where do you go from there? So, how many licks does it take to get to the center of a good security awareness program? You can be that wise old owl, and go with three, but a really good program has a few more layers than that. Having done my own research on where to start, and what tools to use, I stumbled upon a few industry standards and recommendations from our friends in security awareness like SANS, KnowBe4, as well as a few others. But with all things, you have to add your own spin to it. This talk will focus on security awareness best practice, where to start, and how to build a mature program everyone( especially the business) can benefit from.",

Prevention systems and tools help reduce opportunities for adversaries and enable analysts to operate more effectively. The key, however, is to constantly look for attacks that get past security systems and to catch intrusions in progress rather than after attackers have completed their objectives and done worse damage to the business. This process is referred to as \"Threat Hunting\". Armed with an understanding of the general methodologies that the attacker utilizes in modern Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), we can better equip ourselves to defend and disrupt this type of attack. The goal of this workshop is to help train analysts and defenders how to hunt for these threats. Defenders need to choose data sources wisely so that they can see across all of the phases of an attack to give them the best chance of detecting an adversary.",

Find out what is really happening on your networks with this introduction to Wireshark, one of the most popular tools used in industry for network analysis. No prior knowledge is necessary. We will start with a brief introduction to Wireshark, its capabilities and uses. Next, we will discuss where and how to monitor your network with Wireshark and what factors affect those decisions. At this point we are now ready to start applying capture filters, display filters, and custom colorization rules to highlight the information we are interested in seeing. We will focus on understanding several popular network protocols including ARP, IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, HTTP and others. We will also take a look at recently disclosed vulnerability such as the DNS rebinding attacks targeting Roku, Google Home and other devices. The entire workshop will be very hands on with many different sample captures to work from as we identify both normal and abnormal traffic. We will not be doing any live captures.",

The way our brains work drives much of our behavior even security behavior without our being conscious of it. In this talk, I'll share the results of a series of experiments that combine functional magnetic resonance imaging (or fMRI), eye tracking, and traditional usability testing, to show how the way our brains work can sometimes make us the weakest link the security chain.

To detect advanced attack vectors, more than ever, defenders need visibility into endpoint activities to monitor behaviors and spot abnormal activity that can be indicative of malicious activity. While commercial products can provide organizations insight into this endpoint activity, they also can be cost-prohibitive. So what options are available to companies that don't have the hundreds of thousands of dollars necessary to purchase a commercial product? This presentation will show that with the combination of Sysmon (free SysInternls system monitoring tool) and the Elastic Stack (open source data analytics platform) the insight into endpoint activity across the enterprise can be obtained without huge licensing costs. Sysmon grants defenders the capability to record endpoint activity such as process creations, network connections, file writes, process injections, and registry modifications. Combine this with Elastic Stack's ability to ingest, enrich, store, search, visualize, and alert on these records from across the enterprise and suddenly defenders can obtain enterprise-wide endpoint insight at a low cost. Given the power of Sysmon + Elastic Stack, defenders can start to identify malicious scripting, credential theft, scanning, lateral movement, attacker persistence, and attackers covering their tracks throughout their environments.<br>",

He most recently appeared in a cyberwar documentary alongside General Michael Hayden (former Director NSA and CIA).<br>Presentation:<br><br>By leveraging security instrumentation platforms, you are bringing together red and blue teaming initiatives with greater symbiotic mutualism across three major areas. First, you can validate the efficacy of security controls such as firewalls, WAFs, DLPs, EDRs, and SIEMs. If those controls aren't working as needed, you can leverage perspective analytics to instrument them. Second, you can apply configuration assurance to verify that a change that has been made actually does what's desired. You can also determine if that change negatively impacts other facets of security. Third, you can utilize automated, ongoing checks to ensure that what was working continues working in perpetuity. Should something stop functioning, blocking, detecting, correlating, etc., as needed, alerts will be generated in response to the environmental drift. We need to readjust so that we are focusing on security effectiveness and the efficacy of our security controls. We need to industrialize our approach to red and blue teaming with security instrumentation through automation, environmental drift detection, prescriptive actions, and analytics that enable us to finally and empirically manage, measure, and improve security effectiveness.<br>",

Students will assume the roles of both an adversary and the defender, starting as a regular desktop user and gradually escalating privelges and moving laterally across the enterprise. We'll review reconnaisance techniques, discover blind spots, pivot and eventually compromise otherwise-segregated servers. Students will gain invaluable insight into how Active Directory attacks work, understanding the artifacts that they leave behind and practical preventative and monitoring controls. To reduce attack footprint and simulate a real adversary, the playbook is exclusively built on Windows scripts and tools. We will not use Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, etc. Prerequisites: As an introduction class, no previous red or blue-team experience is required. However, students are expected to be familiar with basic Windows and network infrastructure. Basic Powershell and command-line experience is recommended. Equipment: Please bring a laptop computer capable of running at least two Windows 10 VMs (VM image will be distributed prior to class).

      "description": "When news first started to break about a ransomware infection named SamSam, it focused on the high-profile victims, and not so much on the ransomware itself or its operations. Large organizations in the public, healthcare, and education sector, like the City of Atlanta, Adams Memorial Hospital, or Missippippi Valley State University, released breach notifications and information about the ransomware attacks, including how much ransom they paid. In fact, those three sectors of the economy account for only 48% of all victims, fewer than half of the total. Other businesses in the private sector, by comparison, have not made any SamSam-related breach disclosures, though as a result of the research we will present in this talk, we know they comprise 52% of the victim organizations. SamSam came to our attention soon after its appearance. We quickly realized the threat posed by this ransomware was compounded with the single-minded attention of an active attacker who fought hard to bypass multiple layers of network and endpoint security until they succeeded, and then waited until the wee hours in the victims' time zone to begin what turned into an expensive night for the victims. In this talk, we will discuss the stages of a SamSam attack, dissect the malware's quirky behavioral characteristics and evolution, and present our profile of a focused, determined, and slightly paranoid threat actor who learns from mistakes and increasingly builds opsec into each subsequent attack. To track the victims' assets, we engaged a third party who specialize in bitcoin tracking, and discovered a trove of cryptocurrency wallets which, in turn, led to still more victims.",

This will be a lab driven workshop where we will walk attendees from interacting with WMI, gathering data on remote systems, code execution, interacting with remote processes, manipulating services, and more. This workshop will require attendees to have a either a Windows computer, or Windows virtual machine, as we will be writing code throughout the workshop.<br><br>WMI has recently been publicized for its offensive use cases. Attackers, and now red teams, are discovering how powerful WMI can be when used beyond its original intent. Even with the recent surge in WMI use, not everyone knows how to interact with it. This workshop intends to showcase how you can leverage WMI on assessments to do nearly anything you would want to do in a post-exploitation scenario. Want to read files, perform a directory listing, detect active user accounts, run commands (and receive their output), download/upload files, and do all of the above (plus more) remotely? The goal for this workshop will be to enable students to walk away with an understanding of how WMI, a service installed and enabled by default since Windows 2000, is utilized by attackers, demystify interacting with the service locally and remotely, give students the ability to leverage WMI in the same manner as attackers, and walk through the use of WMImplant, a tool which automates this process for users. I want to walk through how and what WMI is for all students. I plan on showing how basic commands can be done through WMI, such as identifying active network interfaces, performing a directory listing, listing running processes, and more. This will largely be done through PowerShell scripting, which I will demo to all students, and students will perform labs throughout the entire workshop. After the initial demos are performed, I plan to showcase more advanced use cases of WMI, such as leveraging WMI for C2, using WMI for data storage, and tying the two together when data storage is required for actions that leverage WMI.",
