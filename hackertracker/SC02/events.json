It is moving away from so much emphasis on compliance and monitoring towards a more strategic role, particularly as CISOs get more and more access to the C-Suite.\n\nA key to success as a CISO is collaboration with and understanding the work of other business units. A large part of the job is not about technology at all. It is about relationships, project management, and learning about several parts of the business.\n\nIt is a good CISO's job to adequately assess and point out the risks to the business of various projects and business practices.\n\nWhat are other key elements that are part of the strategy of a successful CISO? Have you initiated a balanced Security Awareness Program? Is security baked in to your company's SDLC? Are you regularly running scans of both your network and your applications? Are you monitoring your network to detect unusual activity? What about when that dreaded intrusion into your network occurs? Do you know what to do? What about third party risk? Do you have adequate InfoSec policies, standards, and procedures?\n\nJoin me as we take a look at A Day in the Life of a CISO and find out what should be happening at your company.",

Despite the fact that a number of these techniques are now widely used, there tends to be a lack of discussion and clarity around the fundamental underpinnings of the approaches and their inherent tradeoffs.\n\nIn this talk, we'll provide an overview of a number of automated bug finding techniques ranging from the well known, such as fuzzing, dataflow analysis, and blackbox scanning, to less common techniques that are gaining traction, such as symbolic execution, model checking, and abstract interpretation.\n\nFor each technique we'll give a high level introduction that provides you with an intuition for how and why the technique works. Then, we'll discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the technique including the types of bugs and classes of problems it's effective at finding and those it's not. We'll also describe inherent implementation tradeoffs any creator of such a tool needs to make and link to open source tools you can play with as well as conference talks and academic papers you can review to learn more.\n\nYou'll leave this talk with an understanding of the wide variety of automated bug finding approaches out there. You'll know which techniques might be applicable in your own work and you'll have the background knowledge necessary to make more informed decisions when assessing potential open source or commercial tools.",

      "description": "Being able to comprehend causal relationships between sources of user input and their corresponding output is a distinguishing characteristic that separates the master web hacker from the novice script kiddy. The better a tester can grasp these relationships, the faster they can abuse lapses in input sanitization, identify dangerous programming patterns, and understand the overall attack surface of the application.\n\nHowever, enumerating these relationships is difficult and time intensive to do by hand, especially with JavaScript-heavy apps. Security scanning tools have tried to automate this procedure, but they face several problems in modern web applications:\n\nTo solve these problems, we need a tool that augments, not automates, a manual penetration tester by helping them understand all of the inputs and outputs of a web application. To this end, we present Tracy, a tool for assisting penetration testers with enumerating every sink of output for all user input sources.",

      "description": "Have you ever wondered why one of your high-priority vulnerabilities got rejected or delayed even though you thought it was foolish of your company not to implement it in a timely fashion? You probably got slowed down or stopped by the gatekeepers to engineering resources namely product management. However, what product management entails and what the goals of product management are, is rarely explained. I lead a group of product managers in a medical software company, and it is my job to decide which projects make it into the engineering/R&amp;D backlog and which ones are being delayed or even eliminated. I will share the decision-making process and critical questions that need to be answered by any project to make it onto the shortlist. In this presentation, I will provide a view of product management from the inside. Once everybody understands what product management is, what product managers do, why he or she does it, and what his or her decision process is, we can improve the chances of critical IT projects or vulnerability fixes to be completed on time. I believe that together we can build better and more secure products when we understand each other's motivators and goals.",

In this session we will discuss how to leverage your current job skills and life experiences to help you transition your career to the exciting world of cybersecurity.\n\nThere is a high demand for skilled cybersecurity professionals, and not enough qualified candidates to meet this demand. There are also many people who are looking to transition their career to cybersecurity, but do not know how to best approach this transition. This interest is demonstrated by the number of peoplewho enroll in my Ethical Hacking course to help support this transition, as well as the \"newbies\" who attend conferences such as BSides, LayerOne, and (hopefully) ShellCon. The goal of this talk is to help attendees evaluate their existing portfolio of skills and determine how to leverage these skills to transition to a career in cybersecurity. As an example, a software developer would be a natural to transition to helping implement secure coding practices, and a system administrator would be an excellent candidate for evaluating operating systems for security compliance. As a less obvious example, a person with a background in accounting or financing could be great candidates for forensics accounting or evaluating a company's compliance with standards such as SOX.",

This training is excerpted from SANS SEC599: Defeating Advanced Adversaries - Purple Team Tactics &amp; Kill Chain Defenses.\n\nExercises include:\n\nNTLVMv2 Sniffing and Relays vs. Enterprise Hardening\nMalicious scripts vs. Applocker + JEA\nCredential theft: mimikatz vs. Credential Guard\n\nRegister Here!",

      "description": "We've all heard of the shell, and we've all used it at least a little bit. But what IS a shell, really? What makes shell scripting fundamentally different from any other programming language? What really happens when you type a command into your shell--and how does this relate to the mistake found in over 50% of production shell scripts? Attend this talk, demystify the shell and learn to use it right!\n\nThis presentation will give particular attention to security, such as dangers of globbing and dangers of unquoted variables.  The instructor will also take questions- adjusting to the skill level of attendees, each class can go deep and will be unique.\n\nTarget Audience:\nEveryone\nRequired Equipment:\nAn inquiring mind and a willingness to learn.\n\nRegister Here!",

As technology professionals especially, Windows is almost unavoidable. In recent generations, PowerShell has become deeply tied to the Windows operating system and its management. The aim of this workshop is to make you competent in PowerShell quickly. Our approach is simple: We\u2019ll walk through some programming concepts and language particulars. If you\u2019re the curious type, you\u2019ll dig deeper into each area on your own or help us guide the class conversation. If not, you should still be able to stumble though most of the content with us. By the end of the workshop, you should have a working knowledge of PowerShell, the ability to comprehend others' code, as well as the fundamental skills to build your own tools.\n\nPre-Requisites:\n- Laptop with a windows install or VM\n- General understanding of Windows OS and programming concepts",
