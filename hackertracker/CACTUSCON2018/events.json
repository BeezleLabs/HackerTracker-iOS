To reduce attack footprint and simulate a real adversary, the playbook is exclusively built on Windows scripts and tools.  We will not use Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, etc.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: As an introductory class, no previous red or blue-team experience is required.  However, students are expected to be familiar with basic Windows and network infrastructure.  Basic Powershell and command-line experience is recommended.\r\n\r\nEquipment: Please bring a laptop computer capable of running at least two Windows 10 VMs (VM image will be distributed prior to class).

      "description": "Over the past decade, there have been a number of automatic and semi-automatic approaches used to help security professionals find bugs, including dataflow analysis, blackbox web application scanning, fuzzing, and more. Despite the fact that a number of these techniques are now widely used, there tends to be a lack of discussion and clarity around the fundamental underpinnings of the approaches and their inherent tradeoffs.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll provide an overview of a number of automated bug finding techniques, ranging from the well known, such as fuzzing, dataflow analysis, and blackbox scanning, to less common techniques that are gaining traction, such as symbolic execution, model checking, and abstract interpretation.\r\n\r\nFor each technique, we\u2019ll give a high level introduction that provides you with an intuition for how and why the technique works. Then, we\u2019ll discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the technique, including the types of bugs and classes of problems it\u2019s effective at finding, and those it\u2019s not. We\u2019ll also describe inherent implementation tradeoffs any creator of such a tool needs to make, and link to open source tools you can play with as well as conference talks and academic papers you can review to learn more.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll leave this talk with an understanding of the wide variety of automated bug finding approaches out there. You\u2019ll know which techniques might be applicable in your own work, and you\u2019ll have the background knowledge necessary to make more informed decisions when assessing potential open source or commercial tools.",

      "description": "Hands-on incident response roles such as those found within a SOC or CIRT are difficult to staff.  The skill sets required for these roles are vast.  Even when these roles are filled, analysts often find themselves faced with tasks with which they are not familiar.  Certification and higher education programs provide a decent foundation, but they do not produce strong responders.  Even for those environments full of strong responders, analyst skills are often weakened by the onslaught of repetitive tasks, such as fielding phishing ticket, after phishing ticket, after phishing ticket... you get the point.\r\n\r\nAsk yourself: Do all analysts on your team have a firm understanding of your company, the SIEM, advanced networking concepts, network forensics, host-based forensics, malware analysis, threat hunting, and working with intel?  Most likely not.  In this talk, I\u2019ll provide a framework for an on-boarding/baseline training program.  The framework is flexible, allowing for multi-phase deployments or an all-at-once bootcamp style training depending on your needs.\r\n\r\nThe program utilizes experiential training in an effort to teach your analysts the HOWs and WHYs behind their processes and tools.  We don\u2019t need analysts who can push a button to get a banana -- We needs analysts who truly understand the inner-workings of their tools.  For example, what\u2019s the difference between pslist and psscan in volatility?  Which one relies upon pool tags?  What is a pool tag and why do they matter?  Adversaries and red teams rely on weaponization\u2026 why not weaponize your blue team with the tools they need too?",

No longer is kernel compromise the end of the road for attackers attempting to find all the dark secrets stored on your smartphone. Now we have TrustZone, a technology introduced by ARM which provides the \u201cSecure World\u201d. This \u201cSecure World\u201d is separated from the Android kernel which exists in the \u201cNormal World\u201d. Many of the most sensitive operations on your phone are now managed by the TrustZone. These include DRM, fingerprint authentication, and secure file storage, leaving a malicious kernel unable to meddle with them.\r\n\r\nThis talk will demonstrate that despite the enhanced security architecture, a persistent attacker can still prevail. By chaining a number of memory corruption vulnerabilities the author will show how a lowly untrusted app on a Huawei device can compromise the kernel, followed by a trusted app, and eventually the TrustZone kernel itself. Using this access the author will show how the fingerprint trusted module can be patched to accept any fingerprint or even any nose. A demo with nose unlocking will be included.",

However, times are changing and the business models are changing along with it. The rise of ransomware has paralleled a rise in the value of cryptocurrencies, the two are not necessarily connected, but the impact has been.\r\n\r\nFrom an adversary's perspective there are two primary ways of getting these currencies: ransom payouts or mining. Crypto-mining has been around as long as cryptocurrency and it's always been a trade off. Can you earn enough currency to offset the electricity and hardware costs?  Well imagine if you didn't have to worry about either of them.\r\n\r\nThis talk will provide a deep dive into pool mining, and how it is being leveraged by attackers. We will also outline the ways that we've seen adversaries deliver crypto mining programs to end users, the amount of mining capabilities they possess, and some of the financial impacts of their activities. Specific examples of miner distribution campaigns will be provided to give real-world scenarios where attackers are amassing computing resources.",
