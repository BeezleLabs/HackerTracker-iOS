Through this time, he also pursued a PhD in Computer Security, focusing on  Program Analysis. The application of cutting-edge academic program analysis  techniques to CTF (and, later, to his participation in the DARPA Cyber Grand  Challenge, where he led Shellphish to a 3rd-place victory and a big prize  payout) gave Yan a unique understanding of the actual capabilities of the  state of the art of program analysis, which in turn drove his research and  culminated in the release of the angr binary analysis framework and the  Mechanical Phish, one of the world's first autonomous Cyber Reasoning  Systems.
