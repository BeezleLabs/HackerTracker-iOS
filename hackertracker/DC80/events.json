The most difficult part of fuzzing cellular network is building the cellular network environment, not make the corresponding fuzzer. In our representation, we will introduce how to build the 4G LTE environment yourself with limited budget. Afterward, we rewrited the 4G LTE base station and send the malformed LTE message to fuzz your smartphone. After our fuzz testing, we found the vulnerability which could cause your smartphone cannot work as normal and this vulnerability will affect the smartphone which use the specific Qualcomm CPU.",

They have allowed for test case generation at a rate impossible by hand and the creation of test cases humans may never conceive of. While there are many excellent fuzzers available most are designed for mutating source files or input in random ways and attempting to discover edge cases in the handling of them. Some others are designed with structured input in mind and use grammars to more strategically generate and mutate possible inputs that adhere to the format defined. These specifically are the ones we care about for the goals of identifying differences between multiple implementations of a single language, finding bugs in parse tree generation/handling of tokens, and handling of the data at runtime once it has been successfully lexically and syntactically analyzed. We\u2019ll look at some of the shortcomings of existing fuzzers and discuss the implementation for a new platform designed to make fuzzer creation easier with the goal of being able utilize grammars from the implementations of the languages themselves.",

      "description": "Execution of an offensive payload may begin with a safe delivery of the payload to the endpoint itself. When secure connections in the enterprise are inspected, reliance only on transmission level security may not be enough to accomplish that goal. Foxtrot C2 serves one goal: safe last mile delivery of payloads and commands between the external network and the internal point of presence, traversing intercepting proxies, with the end-to-end application level encryption. While the idea of end-to-end application encryption is certainly not new, the exact mechanism of Foxtrot's delivery implementation has advantages to Red Teams as it relies on a well known third party site, enjoying elevated ranking and above average domain fronting features. Payload delivery involves several OpSec defenses: sensible protection from direct attribution, active link expiration to evade consistent interception, inspection, tracking and replay activities by the defenders. Asymmetric communication channels will also be used. And if your standalone Foxtrot agent is caught, the delivery mechanism may live on, you could still manually bring the agent back into the environment via the browser. A concept tool built on these ideas will be presented and released. It will be used as basis for our discussion.",

      "description": "Organizations have been forced to adapt to the new reality: Anyone can be targeted and many can be compromised.This has been the catalyst for many to tighten up operations and revamp ancient security practices. They bought boxes that blink and software that floods the SOC with alerts. Is it enough? The overwhelming answer is: No. The security controls that matter most are the ones that best protect those with the keys to the enterprise, the Active Directory administrators. With this access, an attacker can do anything they want in the environment: access all sensitive data, change access controls and security settings, embed to persist (for years), and often fully manage and control routers, switches, the virtualization platform (VMWare or Microsoft Hyper-V), and increasingly, the cloud platform. Administrators are being dragged into a new paradigm where they have to more securely administer the environment. This involves protecting privileged credentials and limiting access Again the question is: Are the new ways to securely administer Active Directory enough to protect against attackers? Join me in this session to find out. Some of the areas explored in this talk: * Explore how common methods of administration fail. * Demonstrating how attackers can exploit flaws in typical Active Directory administration. * Highlight common mistakes organizations make when administering Active Directory. * Discuss what's required to protect admins from modern attacks. * Provide the best methods to ensure secure administration and how to get executive, operations, and security team acceptance.",

Developers, security teams, and executives alike favor the ease of use and full administrative control Macs provide. However, their systems are often joined to an active directory domain and ripe for attackers to leverage for initial access and lateral movement. Mac malware is evolving as Mac computers continue to grow in popularity. As a result, there is a need for proactive detection of attacks targeting MacOS systems in a enterprise environment. Despite advancements in MacOS security tooling for a single user/endpoint, little is known and discussed regarding detection at a enterprise level. This talk will discuss common tactics, techniques and procedures used by attackers on MacOS systems, as well as methods to detect adversary activity. We will take a look at known malware, mapping the techniques utilized to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Attendees will leave equipped to begin hunting for evil lurking within their MacOS fleet.",

It will be dope as it allows us to dig into topics such as: Is security a fad? How do we differentiate a fad from something here to stay? Encouraging youth to become security engineers, a call-to-action for the community. Deviating from established norms and setting trends, few truly change the industry, and who will change the security industry in the near future? Remembering those who have passed on and learning from their work. How true experts practice their craft (and how to best utilize their skills and share the knowledge) Few things are truly original (and it\u2019s okay, in most cases) Not all legends reach the same pinnacle of success. What separates the best from the rest? How experts make career pivots, and actually pull it off New isn\u2019t always better. We all have beefs (and better ways to resolve them.

It looks at the benefits of adopting IoT for medical devices, current exposure, common communication channels in use as well as interconnectivity approaches used with other critical components. Based off output from security assessments performed against medical devices widely deployed at various hospitals and medical institutions, we will present an in-depth analysis of the target medical device and elaborate on how we were able to compromise them to gain access to plethora of medical records from all the medical institutions they were deployed at and not just the one where our target devices were hosted.We will introduce the threat surface exposed by various medical devices and present some of the real-world attacks against some popular devices & their impact on humans as well as the overall ecosystem they are connected to. Some devices rely on proprietary hardware on licensed bands, which reduces the risk of interference from consumer connected devices, but doesn\u2019t provide security as implied in marketing materials. Others rely on standard WiFi security measures for confidentiality and are prone to MitM attacks. Healthcare devices that implement IrDA could yield interesting results when interfaced with cheap $10 hardware.There are many consumer items that fall under the umbrella of IoT and while it may be hard to understand the impact of hacking a toaster, we can all agree that manipulation of a medical device could lead to rather serious consequences. Apart from putting a patient's life at risk, an attacker could compromise a healthcare device to steal patient data. This presentation will primarily focus on the latter with real-world examples and a case study. We will demonstrate the compromise of a healthcare device to steal medical records, which typically include PII, health insurance data, medical history, SSNs, prescriptions etc.",

More often than not, these extensions are abused for standard crimeware activities, such as ad click fraud, cryptocurrency mining, or stealing banking credentials. But this is only scratching the surface of what is possible if the appropriate browser APIs are abused. Extensions can act as a foothold into a target's internal network, provided a single user can be convinced to click two buttons. As a post-exploitation mechanism, extensions can be side-loaded with the ability to read and write files to disk. These actions will all be performed from the browser process(es) and likely go undetected by conventional endpoint protection solutions. This talk will discuss the creation, deployment, and usage of malicious browser extensions so that other red teamers can add this attack vector to their toolkit.",

Once this system is joined to Active Directory, however, does that static trust model remain the same? Or has the number of attack paths to your data increased by an order of magnitude? We\u2019ve spent the last year exploring the access control model of Active Directory and recently broadened our focus to include security descriptor misconfigurations/backdoor opportunities at the host level. We soon realized that the post-exploitation \u201cattack surface\u201d of Windows hosts spans well beyond what we originally realized, and that host misconfigurations can sometimes have a profound effect on the security of every other host in the forest. This talk will explore a number of lesser-known Active Directory and host-based permission settings that can be abused in concert for remote access, privilege escalation, or persistence. We will show how targeted host modifications (or existing misconfigurations) can facilitate complex Active Directory attack chains with far-reaching effects on other systems and services in the forest, and can allow new AD attack paths to be built without modifying Active Directory itself.",

The use of WMI has also been used in what is referred to as fileless malware, and can even include PowerShell. WMI attacks CAN be detected, and everyone should understand how to search for, detect, and all the Fu that goes along with WMI attacks.  The reason? By default, Windows does log much to detect WMI exploitation, so there is some work to do you need to know about. This talk will show a few examples of WMI exploitation, what and why it can be detected, what you need to configure to catch attacks, what additional things you will need to hunt for WMI pwnage across your environment.

Throughout this talk I will present modern keying techniques and demo some tools to help along the way. I will start with showing how easy it is to discover attacker infrastructure or techniques in the payloads we commonly use every day. I will then quickly review how keying helps and the considerations when generating keyed payloads. Throughout the presentation many practical examples of keying techniques will be provided which can be used for typical pentests or full red team operations. Finally I will introduce KeyServer, a new piece to add to your red team infrastructure which handles advanced HTTP and DNS keying. Using unprotected payloads during ops should be a thing of the past.

      "description": "Over the course of the last few years, PowerShell has been the number one way of conducting essentially any type of offensive operation on Active Directory networks and Windows endpoints. It allows offensive personnel to execute implants completely in memory, stealthily conduct situational awareness, and dynamically leverage the underlying power of .NET. Due to recent protections put in place by Microsoft, PowerShell is becoming increasingly less viable to use offensively. These protections are \"baked in\" to the latest versions of the Windows operating systems and allow AV/EDR/Logging solutions to gain an overwhelming amount of insight into PowerShell execution, and even, in some cases, completely shut down any type of malicious PowerShell tooling/tradecraft. It\u2019s been a good run, and PowerShell has served us well. However, the future is upon us, and it's our job to adapt; we have to go deeper! With that in mind, what if I told you that everything PowerShell does can also be done with Python--without dropping anything to disk and bypassing every protection that Microsoft has put in place for PowerShell? Welcome to the wonderful world of IronPython, where rainbows and unicorns *still* gallivant as if it were 2009!  In this talk, we will be looking at my approach to solving the tradecraft problem of gaining complete, unrestricted, and dynamic access to the .NET runtime without going through PowerShell in any way. I'm going to be walking through the entire process of how I discovered this possibility existed, starting from \"not knowing what I'm doing\" and going to a \"somewhat understanding of what I'm doing\". The talk will cover the progression from creating an initial weaponization PoC all the way up to building an Implant/C2 framework around it and all the success/failures/roadblocks I encountered along the way. Finally, at the end of the talk, I will be releasing the implant/C2 framework which I named SILENTTRINITY to the infosec community.",

Although great strides have been made to consider human factors in cybersecurity and to become more proactive in threat analysis, security is still generally a reactive, technical field.  This research seeks to develop a framework which adapts existing methods such as the cyber kill chain to look at attacks in a less linear, more human-centered framework that focuses on the capabilities and decisions of the threat actor.  In addition, the framework approaches threat analysis from a binary assessment of success vs. failure in order to see the entire attack and consider the potential for a number of methods and attempts made in a single attack.  A detailed methodology and sample charts are included for a reference and a starting point in developing one\u2019s own personalized charts, and recommendations are made for ways to integrate this methodology into the risk management process.",

Best practices are often overlooked or ignored, which can leave gaps throughout an AWS environment that are ripe for exploitation. With an increasing number of breaches leaking AWS secret keys, companies are working to be proactive and are looking for red-team-like post exploitation penetration tests, so that they can be sure that their client data is as safe as possible post-breach.Due to this need and the lack of AWS specific attack tools, I wrote Pacu, an open source Amazon Web Services post exploitation attack tool created and used for Rhino Security Labs pentests.In this talk I will cover how red teamers can use Pacu to simulate real-world attack scenarios against AWS environments, starting from IAM enumeration and scanning through exploitation, privilege escalation, data exfiltration and even providing reporting documentation.",

      "description": "The art of persistence is (and will be...) a matter of concern when successfully exploitation is achieved. Sometimes it is pretty tricky to maintain access on certain environments, especially when it is not possible to execute common vectors like creating or adding users to privileged groups, dumping credentials or hashes, deploying a persistent shell, or anything that could trigger an alert on the victim. This statement ratifies why it's necessary to use discrete and stealthy techniques to keep an open door right after obtaining a high privilege access on the target. What could be more convenient that only use OS resources in order to persist an access? This presentation will provide a new post-exploitation hook applicable to all Windows versions called RID Hijacking, which allows setting desired privileges to an existent account in a stealthy manner by modifying some security attributes. To show its effectiveness, the attack will be demonstrated by using a module which was recently added by Rapid7 to their Metasploit Framework, and developed by the security researcher Sebasti\u00e1n Castro.",

A common practice to achieve this advantage is to elicit information from unwitting individuals through what today is called social engineering (SE). We all hear the term SE so often that we become desensitized to it, thereby INCREASING the effectiveness of it against ourselves and organizations. Thus, will call it what it is - Human Intelligence, also known as HUMINT.Presenting personal experiences as an Army counterintelligence agent with examples of military and industrial espionage, will examine tradecraft employed against individuals every day. We will apply lessons learned from the US military and the intelligence community by using two acronyms taught to Army counterintelligence agents: SAEDA (Subversion and Espionage Directed Against the Army) and MICE (Money, Ideology, Coercion, Ego). By presenting different aspects of HUMINT collection efforts will enable individuals to possibly detect, deflect, and protect oneself from such actions.",

I completely reverse engineered the malware, which runs with root privileges, hijacks all the HTTP traffic on the infected machine, and employs several other nefarious tricks. Due to some stunning opsec mistakes (which I will cover) I found the malware\u2019s authors downright to their full names and the company that they work for. Fast forward almost\u00a0two years later, OSX/Pirrit was back with a vengeance, employing new techniques and learning their lessons from everything I wrote about in my previous reports. Nevertheless, after lots of binary reverse engineering, going through thousands of lines of JavaScript, bash, and AppleScript code - I managed to reveal just how sinister the new version of OSX/pirrit is which is virtually impossible to remove without deep OSX knowledge. Due to more opsec mistakes by the authors I managed to tie this new wave of infections back to On top of that, TargetingEdge, the company who makes this adware/malware, bombarded us with cease and desist letters, threatening my employer and myself personally - trying to keep us from publishing our report.\u00a0In my talk I will highlight all of the methods that were used by the authors of the malware to abuse systems, I will guide the attendees through the process of reverse engineering such malware and share with everyone the amazing and hilarious story behind this whole incident.\u00a0There will be IDA screenshots, there will be stunning opsec mistakes by the authors and there will lolz galore.Join me for a session about reverse engineering, browser hooking tricks on OSX and interesting tales about my time with our corporate attorney battling these legal threats.\u00a0This talk is meant for beginners and experienced audiences alike as I intend to walk through all the phases of my research. Attendees will walk out this talk knowing a lot about the security and the process of malware analysis on macs along with how to handle situations where the malware authors are sending their attorneys on you.",

      "description": "Skilled attackers continually seek out new attack vectors and effective ways of obfuscating old techniques to evade detection. Active defenders can attest to attackers\u2019 prolific obfuscation of JavaScript, VBScript and PowerShell payloads given the ample availability of obfuscation frameworks and their effectiveness at evading many of today\u2019s defenses. However, advanced defenders are increasingly detecting this obfuscation with help from the data science community. This approach paired with deeper visibility into memory-resident payloads via interfaces like Microsoft\u2019s Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) is causing some Red Teamers to shift tradecraft to languages that offer defenders less visibility. But what are attackers using in the wild? In the past year numerous APT and FIN (Financial) threat actors have increasingly introduced obfuscation techniques into their usage of native Windows binaries like wscript.exe, regsvr32.exe and cmd.exe. Some simple approaches entail randomly adding cmd.exe\u2019s caret (^) escape character to command arguments. More interesting techniques like those employed by APT32, FIN7 and FIN8 involve quotes, parentheses and standard input.The most interesting obfuscation technique observed in the wild was FIN7\u2019s use of cmd.exe\u2019s string replacement functionality identified in June 2017. This discovery single-handedly initiated my research into cmd.exe\u2019s surprisingly effective but vastly unexplored obfuscation capabilities. In this presentation I will dive deep into cmd.exe\u2019s multi-faceted obfuscation opportunities beginning with carets, quotes and stdin argument hiding. Next I will extrapolate more complex techniques including FIN7\u2019s string removal/replacement concept and two never-before-seen obfuscation and full encoding techniques \u2013 all performed entirely in memory by cmd.exe. Finally, I will outline three approaches for obfuscating binary names from static and dynamic analysis while highlighting lesser-known cmd.exe replacement binaries. I will conclude this talk by giving a live demo of my cmd.exe obfuscation framework called Invoke-DOSfuscation that obfuscates payloads using these multi-layered techniques. I will also share detection implications and approaches for this genre of obfuscation.",

Azure has a shadow twin no one likes to discuss, GCP hands out public IPs like it\u2019s 1983 again, and AWS is praised as the golden child because they did their homework. While ranting about these quirks Cara and Andy plan on presenting some of the solutions that they have written to deal with a few of the more annoying issues that can rear their ugly heads when deploying in the cloud.",

Even today, many traditional methods will still frequently bypass firewalls and detection, and additional methods continue to be devised. But as an attacker, what do I do when my favorite method is blocked? What are my options other than reusing a stale python script from github or creating my own ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of a high-level messaging protocol? And as a defender, how can I measure my ability to detect the diverse C&C traffic that may be seen today, and also prepare for new and unexpected channels? In this talk, we will discuss the evolution of command and control methods, their strengths and weaknesses from an attacker's perspective, and the capabilities of a defender to detect and respond to them. We will identify what aspects a forward-thinking C&C framework might require, and then demonstrate a proof-of-concept with 99(ish) different interchangeable methods for communication. Finally, we will discuss some of the shortcomings of egress filtering in enterprise environments that should be addressed in order to mature our detection and response in kind.",

      "description": "Linux container technologies offer the ability to run software in isolation with a significantly reduced attack surface. By reducing the capabilities and resources a container can utilize, we make it increasingly difficult to elevate privileges, gain persistence or move laterally within a cluster of containerized services. While Docker is the container technology most people are familiar with, there are other container types to think about too, each with their own opinionated take on security. It\u2019s getting increasingly common to adopt other runtimes through the Open Container Initiative (OCI) specification using interfaces and shims provided by container orchestration platforms. Containers that use Linux namespaces and control groups for isolation typically provide weaker protections against escaping than hypervisor-based containers, further detaching security reality from your hopes and dreams. This presentation will focus on the security and kernel protections available in several popular Linux container technologies including Docker, Rkt, LXC, Kata and gVisor. We will explore how the default runtime security controls stack up under attack and how they attempt to isolate resources at security boundaries. We will explore the container hardening process through AppArmor, SELinux, Seccomp and Capabilities. At the end of this presentation, you\u2019ll be motivated to run minimally privileged containers that are isolated from doing any real damage. You\u2019ll have plenty of time for security when your code is living in a container down by the river.",

Let's take a journey through the demand-side of advertising as we put ourselves in the role of an attacker, build an ad-based surveillance system, and unleash it on the masses. I'll demonstrate how, using the built-in features of advertising Demand Side Platforms (DSPs), it's easy to build a surveillance system that can track unsuspecting people. I'll demonstrate that some platforms make it much easier than it needs to be, and I'll show that there's more than just geo-locations at risk here. Finally I will discuss some ways that everyone can help mitigate this, from the users, all the way up to the ad networks and software developers. Like every good spy story, this one includes Russian ad networks, hastily written code, and GPS coordinates - lots of GPS coordinates. By now if you're still clinging desperately to the hope that your location is safe then this talk is for you!",

      "description": "In cybersecurity, the attacker tends to have a significant advantage over the defender. A motivated network defender should look for opportunities to have an asymmetric advantage over the attacker to level the playing field. In this talk, we will apply the concept of Behavioral Biometrics in the realm of deception technologies to obtain such an advantage. There are three common factors used in authentication: something you know (a password), something you have (a token), and something you are (a biometric). Each factor has its own unique strengths and weaknesses. In the case of biometrics, biometric data is, in many cases, easy to steal and spoof. Once biometric data is stolen, it is impossible to change, since it is inherently tied to the user. Behavioral Biometrics is the authentication paradigm of using an individual\u2019s behavior as a biometric, rather than a fingerprint. The technology looks at how how a user interacts with a system, such as how they type or move the mouse, touch the screen, which hand they hold the device in, the characteristics of their gait from the motion sensor, as well as spatial and temporal patterns. The result is a biometric that is not immediately visible to an attacker, and incredibly difficult to spoof. Traditionally, should behavioral components detect an intrusion, access is blocked, authentication escalated, or the user was de-authed completely. However, this does not necessarily have to be the case. Deception technology has emerged as a method to either delay attackers, coax out their TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), or gather clues about their true identities. This strategy typically includes things such as canaries, honeypots, or tainted or tracked data. The challenge with deception technology is often in identifying an attacker in the first place in order to divert them to fake resources. We will demonstrate in this talk that Behavioral Biometrics are uniquely positioned to identify an attacker as unauthorized, independent of credentials, in a way that is invisible and spoof resistant.  With that information, deceptive technology can redirect their attack in order to delay it, discover the attackers TTPs, or even learn the identity of the attacker as they attempt to exfiltrate mocked data, transfer funds, or use services. We will conclude by demonstrating this combination live.",

      "description": "For a multitude of reasons, many organizations are moving their operations to the cloud. Along with this, many organizations are introducing old vulnerabilities in new ways. As one of the top cloud providers, Microsoft Azure has had significant adoption and continues to grow in market share. As part of this increase in adoption, there has also been an increase in demand for security testing of Azure environments. Given the blended nature of hosted services, PAAS, and virtual infrastructure, it can be difficult to get a handle on how to properly secure these environments. Reviewing Azure environments can also be time consuming given the lack of automated tools for dumping configuration information. MicroBurst is a PowerShell tool that helps automate the processes of dumping and reviewing Microsoft Azure configurations. This talk will go over the ways that pen testers and defenders can use MicroBurst to dump out the configuration information for an Azure environment, and identify common configuration issues. Security testers will benefit from the speed of dumping environment credentials for pivoting, listing out publicly available services and files, and enumerating additional targets for phishing and password guessing attacks. As an added bonus, defenders can also use these tools to audit their environment for weak spots.",

The OS is rich with features you\u2019d expect to find in more expensive Cisco models and it\u2019s been largely protected from bug hunters due to the proprietary protocols it uses with its web client (webfig) and its thick client (winbox).

KillSuit is a little-known part of the DanderSpritz post-exploitation toolkit, leaked by the Shadow Brokers in April 2017. KillSuit is a full featured and versatile framework used by a variety of the Equation Group's tools and implants. KillSuit provides the ability to stealthily establish persistence on machines, install keyloggers, packet capture tools, perform WiFi MITM, and other more information gathering tools. Killsuit includes many interesting ways to silently exfiltrate data and intel - including custom written IPSEC-like protocols and misuse of \"\"disabled\"\" WIFI cards and near-by open networks.",

Stan Hegt and Pieter Ceelen will discuss typical Office security configurations and demonstrate a variety of new offensive techniques within the Office suite. These techniques range from abusing old school Office \u201997 features to abuse of the latest and greatest Office 2016 features. Amongst others, we will demonstrate how to abuse Word documents for gathering sensitive information from systems, how to create phishing documents for credential harvesting without a macro payload, new Office lateral movement techniques and bypasses of security features (such as Attack Surface Reduction), and how to hide your macros from antivirus and analyst tools by abusing interesting features in Office file formats and VBA specifications.",

      "description": "Over the last decade we have seen a rapid rise in virtualization-based tools in which a hypervisor is used to gain insight into the runtime execution of a system. In the earlier days, using virtualization for such \"introspection\" has only been thought of as a technique to develop stealthy rootkits. Today, there are a wide variety of security products using these techniques for services that include, for example, intrusion detection or malware analysis. With such rapid advances in introspection techniques, it is no longer a question of whether a hypervisor can be used to peek inside or even manipulate the VMs it executes. These advances thus beg the question: how can we trust that a hypervisor deployed by a cloud provider will respect the privacy of their customers? While there are hardware-based protection mechanisms guaranteeing data privacy even in the presence of such an introspecting hypervisor, there are no tools that can check whether the hypervisor is introspecting when it shouldn't - until now! We have developed Environmental Characterization and Response (ECR), a software package that analyzes instructions and memory accesses on an unprivileged guest system which has been deployed onto a hypervisor. The package leverages a variety of metrics to determine the potential presence (or lack) of introspection. These techniques are developed to look at micro-architectural properties of modern x86 systems, such as cache-based memory access timing and privileged instruction benchmarking to examine the behavior of the hypervisor. As hypervisors are notoriously known to manipulate time-stamps of virtualized clock-sources when standard instructions are used, we have developed timing methods that are difficult to manipulate by the hypervisor. ECR requires no special software, as the package is built to require the minimum possible amount of dependencies and relies only on standard administrator rights in the VM it runs in.",

No longer is kernel compromise the end of the road for attackers attempting to find all the dark secrets stored on your smartphone. Now we have TrustZone, a technology introduced by ARM which provides the \"Secure World\". This \"Secure World\" is separated from the Android kernel which exists in the \"Normal World\". Many of the most sensitive operations on your phone are now managed by the TrustZone. These include DRM, fingerprint authentication, and secure file storage, leaving a malicious kernel unable to meddle with them. This talk will demonstrate that despite the enhanced security architecture, a persistent attacker can still prevail. By chaining a number of memory corruption vulnerabilities the author will show how a lowly untrusted app on a Huawei device can compromise the kernel, followed by a trusted app, and eventually the TrustZone kernel itself. Using this access the author will show how the fingerprint trusted module can be patched to accept any fingerprint or even any nose. A demo with nose unlocking will be included.",

      "description": "Existing techniques for bypassing wired port security are limited to attacking 802.1x-2004, which does not provide encryption or the ability to perform authentication on a packet-by-packet basis. The development of 802.1x-2010 mitigates these issues by using MacSEC to provide Layer 2 encryption and packet integrity checks to the protocol. Since MacSEC encrypts data on a hop-by-hop basis, it successfully protects against the bridge-based attacks pioneered by the likes of Steve Riley, Abb, and Alva Duckwall. In addition to the development of 802.1x-2010, improved 802.1x support by peripheral devices such as printers also poses a challenge to attackers. Gone are the days in which bypassing 802.1x was as simple as finding a printer and spoofing address, as hardware manufacturers have gotten smarter. In this talk, we will introduce a novel technique for bypassing 802.1x-2010 by demonstrating how MacSEC fails when weak forms of EAP are used. Additionally, we will discuss how improved 802.1x support by peripheral devices does not necessarily translate to improved port-security due to the widespread use of weak EAP. Finally, we will consider how improvements to the Linux kernel have made bridge-based techniques easier to implement and demonstrate an alternative to using packet injection for network interaction. We have packaged each of these techniques and improvements into an open source tool called Silent Bridge, which we plan on releasing at the conference.",

The sessions are 30 min, by appointment, with limited availability for walk-ins. This is a great opportunity to pair hiring experts with job seekers in the security community. This is not a recruiting event and slots fill quickly, so organizers ask folks to send notification if they\u2019re unable to attend during scheduled time. Although there are no guarantees, in 2017 around 50% of participants had a successful interview, job offer, and/or promotion within 30 days of attending the MIRR workshop.

It is simple and straightforward: turn a derby hat \u2014 already a fine piece of functional fashion \u2014 into something more. Exactly how much more is up to you. Feel free to express your hacker spirit in the vein of technological or aesthetic development. There are points awarded by the judges in each of those categories, as well as accolades for overall originality.\r\n\r\nYou may either work on your derby creation before the conference or compete using exclusively what you can source in and around the con hotel during DerbyCon itself. Overall, however, the themes of \u201cmake something new, make something epic, make something awesome\u201d are the order of the day.\r\n\r\nThere will be multiple winners in a variety of categories! All submissions must be displayed to the judges at 6 PM on Saturday (again, location TBA) and scoring will be totaled and finalized by Closing Ceremonies on Sunday.\r\n\r\nFor more information and full detail of the rules and categories, check hackyourderby.com Follow @hackyourderby for updates and to see amazing footage of the submissions!",

      "description": "Most of you know that the first year we did this we actually started in Ohio and cycled our way down to Louisville in the days prior to the con. That\u2019s a bit hard to manage on an annual basis so we settle for doing an early morning ride at the con instead. We\u2019d love for you to join us.  Your best bet for this ride is to bring your own bike if you can. There are places to rent in Louisville and we\u2019ll leave you to your own devices on that front as we generally don\u2019t have enough critical mass for this ride to ask a shop for any deals or special accommodations. Be aware that renting may require you to pick up your bike the day before. Also it appears that Louisville finally has a bike share program so that\u2019s an option as well \u2013 especially since there are pick up stations near the con venue.\r\nRide Details:\r\nMeet Saturday, October 6th, at 7:30am in the Marriott Louisville lobby. You will meet Tom Tufts and Jim Elliott.\r\nThis is a no drop, no setting speed records ride but hopefully we\u2019ll get about 15-20 miles in before finishing.\r\nRoute is TBD, but there will be no major hills (it\u2019s Louisville after all)\r\nWe likely will NOT be back for the first talk of the day but should return with plenty of time to make that 2nd slot. Sorry Saturday morning speakers.\r\nAll riders need to have a bike, helmet, and water bottle (preferably filled with\u2026you know\u2026water).\r\nSome of us have had good luck picking up a bike on Friday for the Saturday 7:30am ride from here: http://www.bikecourier.org/ <- about 10 minute walk from Marriott.\r\nClick here to let us know if you\u2019re coming.
