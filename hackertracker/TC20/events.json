In the F2-420, we found several glaring vulnerabilities, including some that allow remote attackers to gain root access without any authentication. In the course of a few days, ISE obtained 24 CVEs for vulnerabilities we discovered in the TerraMaster F2-420.

They typically bundle application code and a framework platform on top of a thin hypercall-based IO/IPC layer used to perform IO. Typically famous for double (and sometimes single) digit millisecond boot times, Unikernels are a product of security nihilism taken to its logical extreme. Unikernel developers consider most extant software stacks insecure and have taken it upon themselves to throw everything away and reinvent the _entire_ programming and system stack anew. During this talk, we will present our research on unikernel security standings, including our methodology for assessing their implementations of memory hardening techniques. We will also present several attacks against unikernels, with live demonstrations, and suggest mitigation strategies for the weaknesses discovered.",

When the domain had a prior owner(s), even several years prior, they may still possess a valid SSL certificate for it and there is very little you can do about it.\r\n\r\nUsing Certificate Transparency, we examined millions of domains and certificates and found thousands of examples where the previous owner for a domain still possessed a valid SSL certificate for the domain long after it changed ownership. We will review the results from our ongoing large scale quantitative analysis over past and current domains and certificates. We\u2019ll explore the massive scale of the problem, what we can do about it, how you can protect yourself, and a proposed process change to make this less of a problem going forwards.\r\n\r\nWe end by introducing BygoneSSL, a new class of vulnerability where prior domain owners may be able to perform a SSL Man in the Middle, and might even be able to revoke your shared certificates potentially causing Denial of Service. We will demonstrate how widespread the issue is, show domain owners how they can determine if they are affected, and how to protect themselves.\r\n",
