With any luck they'll upload the sample somewhere public so I can find it, but what if I can find out if they start looking for specific bread crumbles in public data sources? At some point without any internal data all blue teams turn to OSINT which puts their searches within view of the advertising industry.

      "description": "Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are devices used on a variety of industrial plants, from small factories to critical infrastructures like nuclear power plants, dams and wastewater systems. Although PLCs were made robust to sustain tough environments, little care was taken to raise defenses against potential cyber threats. As a consequence, threats started pouring in and causing havoc. During this presentation I will talk about the architecture of a PLC and how it can be p0wned. There will be some live demonstration attacks against 3 different brands of PLCs (if the demo demons allow it, if not I will just show a video). Additionally, I will demonstrate two vulnerabilities I recently discovered, affecting the Rockwell MicroLogix 1400 series and the Schneider Modicon M221 controllers.",

      "description": "Recently, the inspection of huge traffic log is imposing a great burden on security analysts. Unfortunately, there have been few research efforts focusing on scalablility in analyzing very large PCAP file with reasonable computing resources. Asura is a portable and scalable PCAP file analyzer for detecting anomaly packets using massive multithreading. Asura's parallel packet dump inspection is based on task-based decomposition and therefore can handle massive threads for large PCAP file without considering tidy parameter selection in adopting data decomposition. Asura is designed to scale out in processing large PCAP file by taking as many threads as possible. \nAsura takes two steps. First, Asura extracts feature vector represented by associative containers of <sourceIP, destIP> pair. By doing this, the feature vector can be drastically small compared with the size of original PCAP files.  In other words, Asura can reduce packet dump data into the size of unique <sourceIP, destIP> pairs (for example, in experiment, Asura's output which is reduced in first step is about 2% compared with the size of original libpcap files). Second, a parallel clustering algorithm is applied for the feature vector which is represented as {<sourceIP, destIP>, V[i]} where V[i] is aggregated flow vector. In second step, Asura adopts an enhanced Kmeans algorithm. Concretely, two functions of Kmeans which are (1)calculating distance and (2)relabeling points are improved for parallel processing. \nIn experiment, in processing public PCAP datasets, Asura can identified 750 packets which are labeled as malicious from among 70 million (about 18GB) normal packets. In a nutshell, Asura successfully found 750 malicious packets in about 18GB packet dump. For Asura to inspect 70 million packets, it took reasonable computing time of around 350-450 minutes with 1000-5000 multithreading by running commodity workstation. Asura will be released under MIT license and available at author's GitHub site on the first day of DEF CON 26.",

      "description": "Though many security mechanisms are deployed in Apple's macOS and iOS systems, some old-fashioned or poor-quality kernel code still leaves the door widely open to attackers. Especially, as kernel's critical components, device drivers are frequently exploited to attack Apple systems. In fact, bug hunting in Apple kernel drivers is not easy since they are mostly closed-source and heavily relying on object-oriented programming. In this talk, we will share our experience of analyzing and attacking Apple kernel drivers. In specific, we will introduce a new tool called Ryuk. Ryuk employs static analysis techniques to discover bugs by itself or assist manual review. \nIn addition, we further combine static analysis with dynamic fuzzing for bug hunting in Apple drivers. In specific, we will introduce how we integrate Ryuk to the state-of-art Apple driver fuzzer, PassiveFuzzFrameworkOSX, for finding exploitable bugs. \n Most importantly, we will illustrate Ryuk's power with several new vulnerabilities that are recently discovered by Ryuk. In specific, we will show how we exploit these vulnerabilities for privilege escalation on macOS 10.13.3 and 10.13.2. We will not only explain why these bugs occur and how we find them, but also demonstrate how we exploit them with innovative kernel exploitation techniques.",

      "description": "In this paper, a new replay attack based on Ethereum smart contracts is presented. In the token transfer, the risk of replay attack cannot be completely avoided when the sender's signatures are abused, which can bring the loss to users. And the reason is that the applying scope of the signatures is not properly designed in the smart contracts. To test and verify this loophole, we selected two similar smart contracts for our experiment, at the same time, we used our own accounts in these two contracts to carry out the experiment. Because the same signatures of the two contracts were used in the experiment, we got a double income from sender successfully. The experiment verified that the replay attack is really exist. Besides, the replay attack may exist in multiple smart contracts. We calculated the number of smart contracts with this loophole, as well as the corresponding transaction activities, which find some Ethereum smart contracts are risked for this loophole. According to the vulnerability of the contract signature, the risk level is calibrated and depicted. Furthermore, the replay attack pattern is extended to within contract, cross contract and cross chain, which provide the pertinence and well reference for protection. Finally, the countermeasures are proposed to fix this vulnerability.",

For decades, fax machines were used worldwide as the main way of electronic document delivery. But this happened in the 1980s. Humanity has since developed far more advanced ways to send digital content, and fax machines are all in the past, right? After all, they should now be nothing more than a glorified museum item. Who on earth is still using fax machines? \nThe answer, to our great horror, is EVERYONE. State authorities, banks, service providers and many others are still using fax machines, despite their debatable quality and almost non-existent security. In fact, using fax machines is often mandatory and considered a solid and trustworthy method of delivering information. \nWhat the Fax?! We embarked on a journey with the singular goal of disrupting this insane state of affairs. We went to work, determined to show that the common fax machine could be compromised via mere access to its fully exposed and unprotected telephone line -- thus completely bypassing all perimeter security protections and shattering to pieces all modern-day security concepts. \nJoin us as we take you through the strange world of embedded operating systems, 30-year-old protocols, museum grade compression algorithms, weird extensions and undebuggable environments. See for yourself first-hand as we give a live demonstration of the first ever full fax exploitation, leading to complete control over the entire device as well as the network, using nothing but a standard telephone line. \nThis talk is intended to be the canary in the coal mine. The technology community cannot sit idly by while this ongoing madness is allowed to continue. The world must stop using FAX!",

      "description": "Are you a malware developer for Android devices? We have very bad news for you: the Android-SDK packager (aapt) is leaking your time zone! We have found a bug inside this Android-SDK's component that relies in not properly setting the value of a variable used as an argument for localtime() function, when setting the \"Last Modified\" field for the Android App's files. Because of this, the time zone of anyone using the Android-SDK packager to generate their APKs is leaked. The curious thing is that, despite of this bug inside aapt, the problem goes even beyond aapt itself: its roots goes deep into an incorrect handling errors in the operative system functions localtime() (Windows) and localtime_r() (UNIX). \nBecause of in the world of Threat Intelligence determining the attacker's geographical location of is one of the most valuable data for attribution techniques, we focused our research in taking advantage of this bug for tracking Android malware developers. In addition to this, we have discovered another very effective way to find out the developer's time zone, based on a calculation of times extracting the GMT timestamp from the Android's app files and the UTC timestamp of the self-signed,\"disposable\" certificate added to the application (most common cases in malware developers). This is what we call: Rock appround the clock! Using these two different techniques, we have crunched some numbers with our 10 million apps database to determine how these leaked time zones (with one or another technique) are related with malware and which are the countries that generate more Android malicious applications, what is the possible relation between time zone and\"malware likelihood\" among other interesting numbers. \nBut that's not all, we have another bad news for malware developers: no IDE (even Android Studio) removes metadata from the files added to the Android app. We will show examples with real cases in which, after analyzing the metadata of files inside the .apk, we got to know country, language, or even more specific geographical location of the developer and -in some cases- the name of the suppose-to-be-anonymous developer! Finally, we will share the scripts we have built to get all this information with just a simple click.",

Precisely because of the lack of adequate understanding, most machines (BIOS / UEFI + operating system) remain vulnerable in the same way as a few years ago. \r\nIn addition, there are a growing number of malwares that have used kernel drivers to circumvent limitations and protections in order to gain full access to the operating system and data. Exactly for these reasons, it is necessary to understand the way that malwares act as device drivers and what are the mechanisms used by these threats to infect an operating system. \r\nThe purpose of this presentation is to show clearly and without too much details that often hinders understanding, how these threats act, which components are attacked, what are the techniques used by these advanced malware to subvert the system and how existing protections work .",

      "description": "With \"Trust none over the Internet\" mindset, securing all communication between a client and a server with protocols such as TLS has become a common practice. However, while the communication over Internet is routinely secured, there is still an area where such security awareness is not seen: inside individual computers, where adversaries are often not expected. \nThis talk discusses the security of various inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms that local processes and applications use to interact with each other. In particular, we show IPC-related vulnerabilities that allow a non-privileged process to steal passwords stored in popular password managers and even second factors from hardware tokens. With passwords being the primary way of authentication, the insecurity of this \"last mile\" causes the security of the rest of the communication strands to be obsolete. The vulnerabilities that we demonstrate can be exploited on multi-user computers that may have processes of multiple users running at the same time. The attacker is a non-privileged user trying to steal sensitive information from other users. Such computers can be found in enterprises with centralized access control that gives multiple users access to the same host. Computers with guest accounts and shared computers at home are similarly vulnerable.",

      "description": "The arbiters of defense wield many static analysis tools; disassemblers, PE viewers, and anti-viruses are among them. When you peer into their minds, these tools reveal their perilous implementations of PE file parsing. They assume PE files come as-is, but the Windows Loader actually applies many mutations (some at the command of the PE itself) before execution ever begins. This talk is about bending that loader to one's whim with the Relocations Table as a command spell. It will demonstrate how the loader can be instrumented into a mutation engine capable of transforming an utterly mangled PE file into a valid executable. This method starts with multiple ASLR Preselection attacks that force binary mapping at a predictable address. It then mangles the PE file, garbling any byte not required prior to relocation. Finally, it embeds a new Relocations Table which, when paired with a preselected base address, causes the loader to reconstruct the PE and execute it with ease. This isn't a packer or a POC, it is a PE rebuilder which generates completely valid, stable, and vastly tool-breaking executables. This talk will show you how this attack twists the protocols of a machine against the controls meant to protect it. It flexes on tools with various look-what-I-can-break demonstrations and, if you write similar tools, it'll make you rethink how you do it.",

BtleJack not only provides an affordable and reliable way to sniff and analyze Bluetooth Low Energy devices and their protocol stacks, but also implements a brand new attack dubbed \"BtleJacking\" that provides a way to take control of any already connected BLE device. \nWe will demonstrate how this attack works on various devices, how to protect them and avoid hijacking and of course release the source code of the tool. \nVendors, be warned: BLE hijacking is real and should be considered in your threat model.",

I wanted to create a mobile version of the paper DEF CON booklet that everyone could use at the con. \r\nI was unable to attend the conference that year. I was 8 months pregnant with my first child, and because I couldn't be there in person, I spent a lot of time wishing I was. \r\nSo I built it. I spent countless hours pouring my heart into what became the Hacker Tracker, shiny graphics and all, and was committing code up until the minute I went into labor. \r\nFast forward a few years: Seth was frustrated with the lack of a mobile app for iOS while attending DEF CON. Subsequently, he found the Android version of Hacker Tracker and reached out to me about creating an iOS version. I was thrilled that someone wanted to join me and help grow the project. Not long after that, I recruited Chris to work on the app as well. \r\nNow, 6 years since its inception, a small team supports the app development across iOS and Android and the apps are being used by half a dozen different conferences, representing several thousand users. \r\nFrom nothing to something, we've experienced quite a bit in 6 years. Join us as we share our moments of joy, fear, and panic,\"things not to do\", and more.",

Stepping away from the smart city fantasy, the reality is actually much more mundane. Many of these technologies have already quietly been deployed in cities across the world. In this talk, we examine the security of a cross-section of smart city devices currently in use today to reveal how deeply flawed they are and how the implications of these vulnerabilities could have serious consequences. \nIn addition to discussing newly discovered pre-auth attacks against multiple smart city devices from different categories of smart city technology, this presentation will discuss methods for how to figure out what smart city tech a given city is using, the privacy implications of smart cities, the implications of successful attacks on smart city tech, and what the future of smart city tech may hold.",

They led me to the over 30 different implementations running in the wild and to a broad and inviting attack surface presented by these banks' digital side doors. \nNow I'd like to guide you through how your Quicken, QuickBooks, Mint.com, or even GnuCash applications are gathering your checking account transactions, credit card purchases, stock portfolio, and tax documents. We'll watch them flow over the wire and learn about the jumble of software your bank's IT department deploys to provide them. We'll discuss how secure these systems are, that keep track of your money, and we'll send a few simple packets at several banks and count the number of security WTFs along the way. \nLastly, I'll demo and release a tool that fingerprints an OFX service, describes its capabilities, and assesses its security.",

Recent advances in machine learning and text-to-speech have shown that synthetic, high-quality audio of subjects can be generated using transcripted speech from the target. Are current techniques for audio generation enough to spoof voice authentication algorithms? We demonstrate, using freely available machine learning models and limited budget, that standard speaker recognition and voice authentication systems are indeed fooled by targeted text-to-speech attacks. We further show a method which reduces data required to perform such an attack, demonstrating that more people are at risk for voice impersonation than previously thought.",

      "description": "These days it's hard to find a business that doesn't accept faster payments. Mobile Point of Sales (mPOS) terminals have propelled this growth lowering the barriers for small and micro-sized businesses to accept non-cash payments. Older payment technologies like mag-stripe still account for the largest majority of all in-person transactions. This is complicated further by the introduction of new payment standards such as NFC. As with each new iteration in payment technology, inevitably weaknesses are introduced into this increasingly complex payment eco-system. \nIn this talk, we ask, what are the security and fraud implications of removing the economic barriers to accepting card payments; and what are the risks associated with continued reliance on old card standards like mag-stripe? In the past, testing for payment attack vectors has been limited to the scope of individual projects and to those that have permanent access to POS and payment infrastructure. Not anymore! \nIn what we believe to be the most comprehensive research conducted in this area, we consider four of the major mPOS providers spread across the US and Europe; Square, SumUp, iZettle and Paypal. We provide live demonstrations of new vulnerabilities that allow you to MitM transactions, send arbitrary code via Bluetooth and mobile application, modify payment values for mag-stripe transactions, and a vulnerability in firmware; DoS to RCE. Using this sampled geographic approach, we are able to show the current attack surface of mPOS and, to predict how this will evolve over the coming years. \nFor audience members that are interested in integrating testing practices into their organization or research practices, we will show you how to use mPOS to identify weaknesses in payment technologies, and how to remain undetected in spite of anti-fraud and security mechanisms.",

One of its new features is 0-RTT (Zero Round Trip Time Resumption) that could potentially allow replay attacks. This is a known issue acknowledged by the TLS 1.3 specification, as the protocol does not provide replay protections for 0-RTT data, but proposed countermeasures that would need to be implemented on other layers, not at the protocol level. Therefore, the applications deployed with TLS 1.3 support could end up exposed to replay attacks depending on the implementation of those protections. \n      This talk will describe the technical details regarding the TLS 1.3 0-RTT feature and its associated risks. It will include Proof of Concepts (PoC) showing real-world replay attacks against TLS 1.3 libraries and browsers. Finally, potential solutions or mitigation controls would be discussed that will help to prevent those attacks when deploying software using a library with TLS 1.3 support.",

      "description": "While most IoT accessory manufacturers have a narrow area of focus, Xiaomi, an Asian based vendor, controls a vast IoT ecosystem, including smart lightbulbs, sensors, cameras, vacuum cleaners, network speakers, electric scooters and even washing machines. In addition, Xiaomi also manufactures smartphones. Their products are sold not only in Asia, but also in Europe and North America. The company claims to have the biggest IoT platform worldwide.\n\n\nIn my talk, I will give a brief overview of the most common, Wi-Fi based, Xiaomi IoT devices. Their devices may have a deep integration in the daily life (like vacuum cleaners, smart toilet seats, cameras, sensors, lights).\n\n\nI will focus on the features, computational power, sensors, security and ability to root the devices. Let\u2019s explore how you can have fun with the devices or use them for something useful, like mapping Wi-Fi signal strength while vacuuming your house. I will also cover some interesting things I discovered while reverse engineering Xiaomi's devices and discuss which protections were deployed by the developers (and which not).\n\n\nBe prepared to see the guts of many of these devices. We will exploit them and use them to exploit other devices.",

In this Fireside Hax, we will challenge your assumptions about trolling. Trolls are attention hackers, using social and technical means to bait journalists, set agendas, game media gatekeepers, and direct audiences. Sometimes they also have fun. We will discuss a range of trolling techniques like sockpuppeting, dogpiling, doxing, attention honeypots, and cognitive denial of service attacks that we have not seen concisely catalogued elsewhere. We will also discuss high-profile examples of trolling such as\"training\" the Microsoft Tay chatbot, fake Antifa accounts, Russian sockpuppet accounts, and Phineas Fisher's use of Hacking Team's twitter account--and ask attendees to consider each as black hat attacks or grey hat attempts to point out critical societal vulnerabilities that should be\"patched.\" We will also talk about\"troll the troll\" accounts like ImposterBuster and YesYoureRacist and the role\"white hat trolls\" might play in auditing platforms or proposing platform-based controls. Time permitting, we will discuss art projects that trollishly critiqued the European Commission, Google AdSense, and the NSA. This will not be a lecture and it will not shy away from controversy. Join two members of the Media Manipulation Team at Data & Society to collectively consider the role trolling can play in pointing out the flaws in our attention/media landscape.",

It is becoming more and more difficult to remotely compromise Android phones especially Google\u2019s Pixel phone.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pixel phone is protected by many layers of security. It was the only device that was not pwned in the 2017 Mobile Pwn2Own competition. But our team discovered a remote exploit chain\u2014the first of its kind since the Android Security Rewards (ASR) program expansion, which could compromise The Pixel phone remotely. The exploit chain was reported to Android security team directly. They took it seriously and patched it quickly. Because of the severity and our detailed report, we were awarded the highest reward ($112,500) in the history of the ASR program.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will detail how we used the exploit chain to inject arbitrary code into system_server process and get system user permissions. The exploit chain includes two bugs, CVE-2017-5116 and CVE-2017-14904. CVE-2017-5116 is a V8 engine bug related with Webassembly and SharedArrayBuffer. It is used to get remote code execution in sandboxed Chrome render process. CVE-2017-14904 is a bug in Android's libgralloc module that is used to escape from the sandbox. The way we used for sandbox escaping is very interesting, rarely talked about before. All details of vulnerabilities and mitigation bypassing techniques will be given in this talk.",

      "description": "Although vulnerabilities stemming from the deserialization of untrusted data have been understood for many years, unsafe deserialization continues to be a vulnerability class that isn't going away. Attention on Java deserialization vulnerabilities skyrocketed in 2015 when Frohoff and Lawrence published an RCE gadget chain in the Apache Commons library and as recently as last year's Black Hat, Mu\u00f1oz and Miroshis presented a survey of dangerous JSON deserialization libraries. While much research and automated detection technology has so far focused on the discovery of vulnerable entry points (i.e. code that deserializes untrusted data), finding a \"gadget chain\" to actually make the vulnerability exploitable has thus far been a largely manual exercise. In this talk, I present a new technique for the automated discovery of deserialization gadget chains in Java, allowing defensive teams to quickly identify the significance of a deserialization vulnerability and allowing penetration testers to quickly develop working exploits. At the conclusion we will also be releasing a FOSS toolkit which utilizes this methodology and has been used to successfully develop many deserialization exploits in both internal applications and open source projects.",

Most of these smart speakers have natural language recognition, chat, music playback, IoT device control, shopping, and so on. Manufacturers use artificial intelligence technology to make smart speakers have similar human capabilities in the chat conversation. However, with the smart speakers coming into more and more homes, and the function is becoming more powerful, its security has been questioned by many people. People are worried that smart speakers will be hacked to leak their privacy, and our research proves that this concern is very necessary.\nIn this talk, we will present how to use multiple vulnerabilities to achieve remote attack some of the most popular smart speakers. Our final attack effects include silent listening, control speaker speaking content and other demonstrations. And we're also going to talk about how to extract firmware from BGA packages Flash chips such as EMMC, EMCP, NAND Flash, etc. In addition, it contains how to turn on debug interfaces and get root privileges by modifying firmware content and Re-soldering Flash chips, which can be of great help for subsequent vulnerability analysis and debugging. Finally, we will play several demo videos to demonstrate how we can remotely access some Smart Speaker Root permissions and use smart speakers for eavesdropping and playing voice.",

      "description": "When caching servers and load balancers became an integral part of the Internet's infrastructure, vendors introduced \"Edge Side Includes\" (ESI), a technology allowing malleability in caching systems. This legacy technology, still implemented in nearly all popular HTTP surrogates (caching/load balancing services), is dangerous by design and brings a yet unexplored vector for web-based attacks. \nThe ESI language consists of a small set of instructions represented by XML tags, served by the backend application server, which are processed on the Edge servers (load balancers, reverse proxies). Due to the upstream-trusting nature of Edge servers, ESI engines are not able to distinguish between ESI instructions legitimately provided by the application server and malicious instructions injected by a malicious party. We identified that ESI can be used to perform SSRF, bypass reflected XSS filters (Chrome), and perform Javascript-less cookie theft, including HTTPOnly cookies. \nIdentified affected vendors include Akamai, Varnish, Squid, Fastly, WebSphere, WebLogic, F5, and countless language-specific solutions (NodeJS, Ruby, etc.). This presentation will start by introducing ESI and visiting typical infrastructures leveraging it. We will then delve into identification, exploitation of popular ESI engines, and mitigation.",

      "description": "Pre-installed apps and firmware pose a risk due to vulnerabilities that can be pre-positioned on a device, rendering the device vulnerable on purchase. This means that the vulnerabilities are present even before the user enables wireless communications and starts installing third-party apps. To quantify the exposure of the Android end-users to vulnerabilities residing within pre-installed apps and firmware, we analyzed a wide range of Android vendors and carriers using devices spanning from low-end to flagship. Our primary focus was exposing pre-positioned threats on Android devices sold by United States (US) carriers, although our results affect devices worldwide. We will provide details of vulnerabilities in devices from all four major US carriers, as well two smaller US carriers, among others. The vulnerabilities we discovered on devices offered by the major US carriers are the following: arbitrary command execution as the system user, obtaining the modem logs and logcat logs, wiping all user data from a device (i.e., factory reset), obtaining and modifying a user\u2019s text messages, sending arbitrary text messages, and getting the phone numbers of the user\u2019s contacts, and more. All of the aforementioned capabilities are obtained outside of the normal Android permission model. Including both locked and unlocked devices, we provide details for 37 unique vulnerabilities affecting 25 Android devices with 11 of them being sold by US carriers. In this talk, we will present our framework that is capable of discovering 0-day vulnerabilities from binary firmware images and applications at scale allowing us to continuously monitor devices across different manufacturers and firmware versions. During the talk, we plan to perform a live demo of how our system works.",

While fuzzing has long been relied on by security researchers to identify software bugs, applying fuzzing methodologies to RF and hardware systems has historically been challenging due to siloed tools and the limited capabilities of commodity RF chipsets.\n\n\nWe created the TumbleRF fuzzing orchestration framework to address these shortfalls by defining core fuzzing logic while abstracting a hardware interface API that can be mapped for compatibility with any RF driver.  Thus, supporting a new radio involves merely extending an API, rather than writing a protocol-specific fuzzer from scratch.\n\n\nAdditionally, we introduce Orthrus, a low-cost 2.4 GHz offensive radio tool that provides PHY-layer mutability to offer Software Defined Radio-like features in a flexible and low-latency embedded form factor.  By combining the two, researchers will be able to fuzz and test RF protocols with greater depth and precision than ever before.\n\n\nAttendees can expect to leave this talk with an understanding of how RF and hardware physical layers actually work, and how to identify security issues that lie latent in these designs.",

      "description": "In 2017, FireEye conducted an incident response at a critical infrastructure facility where a sophisticated threat actor deployed the TRITON attack framework for implanting Safety Instrumented System (SIS) controllers with a passive backdoor, which would allow an attacker to inject potentially destructive payloads at a later point in time. TRITON is the most complex publicly known embedded system exploit to date. While the functionality of the malware is understood, little known about attacker efforts when developing such an implant. With a timeline of exploit development like TRITON being in a year range, complex embedded exploitation is currently considered to be a boutique hacking. However, the public release of much of the TRITON code can now facilitate less experienced threat actors with designing similar exploits. The goal of this talk is to provide the audience with a\"through the eyes of the attacker\" experience when designing advanced embedded systems exploits for Industrial Control Systems (ICS). This talk is based on our extensive experience in reverse engineering Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS)/firmwares and developing embedded exploits to cause physical damage. \nIn the first part of the talk we will explain how to convert an 'undocumented device' into malicious code. We will share how to purchase industrial equipment and obtain needed documentation. \nAfter obtaining control over an embedded system, an actual attack still need to be performed. In the second part of the talk will concentrate on discovering exploitable firmware and hardware design features which would allow an attacker to impact industrial controller functions. We will present several scenarios such as hijacking internal clock, suppressing interrupts (IRQ config attack) and manipulation of the interrupt vector table (IVT), CPU pin configuration attack and placing code into TCM cache so it would not be even visible in the memory. \nThe TRITON payload can be thought of as a four-stage shellcode. Attack code related to first three stages constituted a discussed backdoor implant capable of receiving and executing the fourth stage. This stage would have been an actual 'physical damage payload' performing the disruptive operations. However, the attacker was discovered while preparing the implant, before advancing to physical damage stage. In this part of the talk we will show how one can symbolically execute TRITON using ANGR framework and test a code for damage scenario written for any CPU/hardware architecture of choice. \nDeveloping embedded exploits requires a significant amount of effort but it is totally worth of investment. While a small fraction of asset owners is slowly embracing ICS network monitoring solutions, the attackers are going one layer lower\u2014into the control equipment (race-to-the-bottom). Developing embedded implants is worth the efforts due to lacking tools for detecting such implants and we will see more of advanced embedded exploitation in the nearest future. \nNote to reviewers: current abstract is too long and probably would need to be shortened if the application is selected for the presentation",

The testimony made national news when the group announced they could take down the Internet in 30 minutes. It was also the first-time hackers using handles appeared before a US Legislative body. \nMembers of the L0pht have grown from their hacker roots to become distinguished leaders and contributors in the security community and beyond. They run multi-million dollar security-focused organizations, have lobbied the government for better security laws, work for some of the largest companies in the world, and continue to spread the message of the positive aspects of hacking. \nWith several of the L0pht's original members, this discussion will cover the original testimony and the changes that have happened over the last 20 years. Is the government any more secure? Have they provided enough influence to help protect its citizens' data? What steps should we take to ensure user security and privacy in the future? We are hoping for audience participation and also welcome questions about any other time in the L0pht's relatively short, but poignant, existence.",

They can be found in universities, modern office buildings, sports arenas, and even high-end Las Vegas hotel rooms. If an environment has a lot of audio/video infrastructure, needs to interconnect or automate different IoT and building systems, or just wants the shades to close when the TV is turned on, chances are high that a Crestron device is controlling things from behind the scenes. And as these types of environments become the norm and grow ever more complex, the number of systems that Crestron devices are connected to grows as well. But it is in large part because of this complexity that installing and programming these devices is difficult enough without considering adding security. Instead of being a necessity, it's an extra headache that almost always gets entirely passed over. In this talk, I will take a look at different Crestron devices from a security perspective and discuss the many vulnerabilities and opportunities for fun to be found within. I will demonstrate both documented and undocumented features that can be used to achieve full system compromise and show the need to make securing these systems a priority, instead of an afterthought, in every deployment. In short, hijinx will ensue.",

      "description": "Typically, the activities of a malware attack occur on an execution timeline that generally consists of 3 segments\u2014the vector, the stage, and the persistence. First, a vector, or method of exploitation is identified. This could be anything from logging in over a credentialed method like RDP or SSH and running a malicious payload directly, to exploiting a memory corruption vulnerability remotely. Second, that access is leveraged into running malicious code that prepares the victim for the deployment of persistence (commonly \"implant\"). While segments one and three have been extensively automated, a effective automated utility for deploying persistence in a dynamic and unified context has yet to present itself. \nEnter the Genesis Scripting Engine. \nThe Genesis Scripting Engine, or Gscript for short, is a framework for building multi-tenant executors for several implants in a stager. The engine works by embedding runtime logic (powered by the V8 Javascript Virtual Machine) for each persistence technique. This logic gets run at deploy time on the victim machine, in parallel for every implant contained with the stager. The Gscript engine leverages the multi-platform support of Golang to produce final stage one binaries for Windows, Mac, and Linux. \nThis talk will consist of an overview of the origins of the project,  a technical deep dive into the inner workings including the modified Javascript VM, a walk through of the CLI utility, and examples of how we've leveraged Gscript in the real world. \nMultiple demos involving practical application scenarios will be presented, as well as an opportunity for audience members to submit their own implants and have them built into a hydra on stage in a matter of minutes.",

      "description": "Surveillance had been a fact of life for sex workers wherever they have faced prohibition. Only two elements, communication and association, can differentiate between commercial and personal sex, criminal enforcement of prostitution laws have necessarily meant targeting the speech and affiliation of perceived sex workers. Enforcement of this nature is facilitated by profiling, institutional bias, and broad overreaching policies that fundamentally violate individual human rights. This has included condoms as evidence, non-consensual medical screenings, and targeted harassment of black transgender women as well as license plate recording projects and stings that focus disrupting immigration or migrant workers.  \r\nFor all of its risks, screening potential clients is safer over email than it is in person during a street based negotiation often in an isolated part of town. SESTA (Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act) comes at a time when compelling research demonstrates that Craigslist resulted in a 17% drop in the female homicide rate. SESTA will also put victims at risk by delaying their identification and recovery by eliminating a digital paper trail. Additionally, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is a vital protection for a free internet. Subverting SESTA will create greater economic disparity between sex workers and ultimately empower pimps and agencies over independent  providers.",

The good news: this is likely to make your life easier as an attacker. \nWhile exploitation and manipulation of traditional monolithic applications might require specialized experience and training in the target languages and execution environment, applications made up of services distributed among multiple containers can be effectively explored and exploited \"from within\" using many of the system- and network-level techniques that attackers, such as penetration testers, already know. \nThe goal of this talk is to provide a hacker experienced in exploitation and post-exploitation of networks and systems with an exposure to containerization and the implications it has on offensive operations.

      "description": "It seems each day that passes brings new technology and an increasing dependence upon it. The medical field is no exception; medical professionals rely upon technology to provide them with accurate information and base life-changing decisions on this data. \nIn recent years there has been more attention paid to the security of medical devices; however, there has been little research done on the unique protocols used by these devices. In large, health care systems medical personnel take advantage of to make decisions on patient treatment and other critical care, use central monitoring stations. This information is gathered from many devices on the network using uncommon networking protocols.  What if this information wasn't accurate when a doctor prescribed medication?  What if a patient was thought to be peacefully resting, when in fact they are under cardiac arrest? \nMcAfee's Advanced Threat Research team has discovered a weakness in the RWHAT protocol, one of the networking protocols used by medical devices to monitor a patient's condition.  This protocol is utilized in some of the most critical systems used in hospitals.  This weakness allows the data to be modified by an attacker in real-time to provide false information to medical personnel.   Lack of authentication also allows rogue devices to be placed onto the network and mimic patient monitors.   \nThis presentation will include a technical dissection of the security issues inherent in this relatively unknown protocol.  It will describe real-world attack scenarios and demonstrate the ability to modify the communications in-transit to directly influence the receiving devices.  We will also explore the general lack of security mitigations in the medical devices field, the risks they pose, and techniques to address them.  The talk will conclude with a demonstration using actual medical device hardware and a live modification of a patient's critical data.",

None of this matters as much as how administration is performed: Pop an admin, own the system. Admins are being dragged into a new paradigm where they have to more securely administer the environment. What does this mean for the pentester or Red Teamer? \nAdmins are gradually using better methods like two-factor and more secure administrative channels. Security is improving at many organizations, often quite rapidly. If we can quickly identify the way that administration is being performed, we can better highlight the flaws in the admin process. \nThis talk explores some common methods Active Directory administrators (and others) use to protect their admin credentials and the flaws with these approaches. New recon methods will be provided on how to identify if the org uses an AD Red Forest (aka Admin Forest) and what that means for one hired to test the organization's defenses, as well as how to successfully avoid the Red Forest and still be successful on an engagement.\nSome of the areas explored in this talk:\n\t",

A recent (2016) Johns Hopkins University market survey found 60 different models have been produced specifically for law enforcement use. Rapid adoption is fueling this meteoric increase in availability and utilization. Additionally, device manufactures are attempting to package more and more technology into these devices. This has caused a deficiency in local municipalities' skills and budget to accurately assess the attack surface and exposure to the organization. Furthermore, departmental policies and procedures governing the secure deployment of these devices is largely insufficient. \nAt DEF CON, we will be introducing tactics, techniques, and procedures to assess the security of these devices. We will cover attacks against the physical devices, RF components, smartphone app's, and desktop software. The capabilities demonstrated and discussed will encompass publicly and privately available technologies. Additionally, the talk will cover multiple products and vendors, shedding light on industry wide issues and trends. Finally, we will be releasing software to detect and track various devices and tie these issues into real world events.",

In spite of how popular CRIME and BREACH were, little was talked about how this class of attacks was relevant to VPN networks. Compression oracle attacks are not limited to just TLS protected data. In this talk, we try these attacks on browser requests and responses which usually tunnel their HTTP traffic through VPNs. We also show a case study with a well-known VPN server and their plethora of clients. We then go into practical defenses and how mitigations in HTTP/2's HPACK and other mitigation techniques are the way forward rather than claiming 'Thou shall not compress traffic at all.' One of the things that we would like to showcase is how impedance mismatches in these different layers of technologies affect security and how they don't play well together.",

      "description": "Commercial Android emulators such as NOX, BlueStacks and Leidian are very popular at the moment and most games can run on these emulators fast and soundly. The bad news for game vendors is that these emulators are usually shipped with root permission in the first place. On the other hand, cheating tools developers are happy because they can easily distribute their tools to abusers without requiring the abusers to have a physical rooted device, nor do they need to perform laborious tuning for different Android OS / firmware version. However, luckily for game vendors, commercial Android emulators usually use an x86/ARM mixed-mode emulation for speed-up. As a result, a standard native hooking/DBI framework won't work on this kind of platform. This drawback could discourage the cheating developers. \nIn this talk, I will introduce a native hooking framework on such a kind of mixed-mode emulators. The talk will include the process start routine of both command-line applications and Android JNI applications as well as how these routines differ on an emulator. The different emulation strategies adopted by different emulators and runtime environments (Dalvik/ART) will also be discussed. Based on these knowledge, I will explain why the existing hooking/DBI frameworks do not work on these emulators and how to make one that works. \nLastly, I will present a demo of using this hooking framework to cheat a game on emulator. With this demo, I will discuss how the dark market of mobile game cheating may develop in the foreseeable future.",

A lesser known fact is that about a decade ago, two industrial wireless protocols (WirelessHART and ISA100.11a) have been designed for industrial applications, which are based on the common IEEE 802.15.4 RF standard. These Wireless Industrial Sensor Networks (WISN) are used in process field device networks to monitor temperature, pressure, levels, flow or vibrations. The petrochemical industry uses WISN in oil and gas fields and plants around the world. \nBoth IEC ratified standards have been commonly praised by the ICS industry for their security features, including strong encryption on multiple layers within the protocol stack, resistance to RF interference, and replay protection. While the standards in general look safe on paper, there are potential interesting attack vectors that require verification. However, security research so far has not yielded any significant results beyond basic attack vectors. Often these attacks have only been theorized, and not (publically) demonstrated. In addition, vendor implementations have not been thoroughly tested for security by independent third parties, due to protocol complexity and the lack of proper (hardware/software) tools. We strongly believe in Wright's principle,\"Security does not improve until practical tools for exploration of the attack surface are made available.\"",

Since these apps deal with highly sensitive information, they immediately raise questions on privacy and security. Who else can track the users? Is this data properly protected? To answer these questions, we analyzed a selection of the most popular tracking apps from the Google Play Store. \nMany apps and services suffer from grave security issues. Some apps use self-made algorithms instead of proper cryptography for data storage and transmission. Others do not even attempt to protect their communication at all and make use of the unprotected http protocol, or even give an attacker full access to a vulnerable backend system. Hard coded database credentials in apps allowed access to all stored user locations. We would be able to extract hundreds of thousands of tracking profiles, even in real time. In others, this wasn't even necessary, because the user authentication could be bypassed altogether. Flaws in server API allowed us to extract all user credentials (1.7m plain text passwords), further we saw full communication histories containing messages, pictures and location data. \nIn total, the state of tracker apps is worrisome, effectively leading to users unknowingly installing espionage software on their devices.",

      "description": "Extreme network's embedded WingOS (Originally created by Motorola) is an operating system used in several wireless devices such as access points and controllers. This OS is being used in Motorola devices, Zebra devices and Extreme network's devices. This research started focusing in an access point widely used in many Aircrafts by several worldwide airlines but ended up in something bigger in terms of devices affected as this embedded operating system is not only used in AP's for Aircrafts but also in Healthcare, Government, Transportation, Smart cities, small to big enterprises... and more. \nBased on public information, we will see how vulnerable devices are actively used (outdoors) in big cities around the world. But also in Universities, Hotels,Casinos, Big companies, Mines, Hospitals and provides the Wi-Fi access for places such as the New york City Subway. \nIn this presentation we will show with technical details how several critical vulnerabilities were found in this embedded OS. First we will introduce some internals and details about the OS and then we will show the techniques used to reverse engineering the mipsN32 ABI code for the Cavium Octeon processor. It will be discussed how some code was emulated to detect how a dynamic password is generated with a cryptographic algorithm for a root shell backdoor. Besides, it will be shown how some protocols used by some services were reverse engineered to find unauthenticated heap and stack overflow vulnerabilities that could be exploitable trough Wireless or Ethernet connection. \nThis OS also uses a proprietary layer 2/3 protocol called MiNT. This protocol is used for communication between WingOS devices through VLAN or IP. This protocol was also reverse engineered and remote heap/stack overflow vulnerabilities were found on services using this protocol and will be shown. As a live demonstration, 2 devices will be used to exploit a remote stack overflow chaining several vulnerabilities as the attacker could do inside an aircraft (or other scenarios) through the Wi-Fi. As there are not public shellcodes for mipsN32 ABI, the particularities of creating a Shellcode for mipsN32 ABI will be also discussed.",

      "description": "Public keys are everywhere, after all, they are public. These keys are waiting to be reaped by those who know their real value. Hidden behind this public face lurks some potentially dangerous issues which could lead to a compromise of data and privacy. \nLeveraging hundreds of minion devices, we built a public key reaping machine (which we are open sourcing) and operated it on a global scale. Collected keys are tested for vulnerabilities such as the recent ROCA vulnerability or factorization using batch-GCD. We've collected over 300 million keys so far and built a database 4 to 10 times bigger than previous public works. \nPerforming the initial computation on over 300 million keys took about 10 days on a 280 vCPU cluster. Many optimizations allow our tool to incrementally test new RSA keys for common prime factors against the whole dataset in just a few minutes. \nAs a result of our research, we could have impersonated hundreds of people by breaking their PGP keys, mimicked thousands of servers thanks to their factored SSH keys and performed MitM attacks on over 200k websites relying on vulnerable X509 certificates. \nIn the end, we were able to do this in an entirely passive way. Going further is possible, but it would lead us to the dark side. Would big brother hesitate to go there?",

      "description": "In a world of high volume malware and limited researchers we need a dramatic improvement in our ability to process and analyze new and old malware at scale. Unfortunately what is currently available to the community is incredibly cost prohibitive or does not rise to the challenge. As malware authors and distributors share code and prepackaged tool kits, the corporate sponsored research community is dominated by solutions aimed at profit as opposed to augmenting capabilities available to the broader community. With that in mind, we are introducing our library for malware disassembly called Xori as an open source project. Xori is focused on helping reverse engineers analyze binaries, optimizing for time and effort spent per sample. \nXori is an automation-ready disassembly and static analysis library that consumes shellcode or PE binaries and provides triage analysis data. This Rust library emulates the stack, register states, and reference tables to identify suspicious functionality for manual analysis. Xori extracts structured data from binaries to use in machine learning and data science pipelines. \nWe will go over the pain-points of conventional open source disassemblers that Xori solves, examples of identifying suspicious functionality, and some of the interesting things we've done with the library.  We invite everyone in the community to use it, help contribute and make it an increasingly valuable tool for researchers alike.",

      "description": "Fuzzers have played an important role in the discovery of reliability and security flaws in software for decades. They have allowed for test case generation at a rate impossible by hand and the creation of test cases humans may never conceive of. While there are many excellent fuzzers available most are designed for mutating source files or input in random ways and attempting to discover edge cases in the handling of them. Some others are designed with structured input in mind and use grammars to more strategically generate and mutate possible inputs that adhere to the format defined. These specifically are the ones we care about for the goals of identifying differences between multiple implementations of a single language, finding bugs in parse tree generation/handling of tokens, and handling of the data at runtime once it has been successfully lexically and syntactically analyzed. We'll look at some of the shortcomings of existing fuzzers and discuss the implementation for a new platform designed to make fuzzer creation easier with the goal of being able utilize grammars from the implementations of the languages themselves.",

      "description": "Existing techniques for bypassing wired port security are limited to attacking 802.1x-2004, which does not provide encryption or the ability to perform authentication on a packet-by-packet basis [1][2][3][4]. The development of 802.1x-2010 mitigates these issues by using MacSEC to provide Layer 2 encryption and packet integrity check to the protocol [5]. Since MacSEC encrypts data on a hop-by-hop basis, it successfully protects against the bridge-based attacks pioneered by the likes of Steve Riley, Abb, and Alva Duckwall [5][6]. \nIn addition to the development of 802.1x-2010, improved 802.1x support by peripheral devices such as printers also poses a challenge to attackers. Gone are the days in which bypassing 802.1x was as simple as finding a printer and spoofing address, as hardware manufacturers have gotten smarter. \nIn this talk, we will introduce a novel technique for bypassing 802.1x-2010 by demonstrating how MacSEC fails when weak forms of EAP are used. Additionally, we will discuss how improved 802.1x support by peripheral devices does not necessarily translate to improved port-security due to the widespread use of weak EAP. Finally, we will consider how improvements to the Linux kernel have made bridge-based techniques easier to implement and demonstrate an alternative to using packet injection for network interaction. We have packaged each of these techniques and improvements into an open source tool called Silent Bridge, which we plan on releasing at the conference.",

In most cases their authors do not follow the best secure software development practices thereby introducing an interesting attack scenario which can be used to stop or slow-down malware spreading, defend against DDoS attacks and take control over C&Cs and botnets. Several previous researches have demonstrated that such bugs exist and can be exploited. To find those bugs it would be reasonable to use coverage-guided fuzzing. \nThis talk aims to answer the following two questions: ___ we defend against malware by exploiting bugs in them ? How can we use fuzzing to find those bugs automatically ? \nThe author will show how we can apply coverage-guided fuzzing to automatically find bugs in sophisticated malicious samples such as botnet Mirai which was used to conduct one of the most destructive DDoS in history and various banking trojans. A new cross-platform tool implemented on top of WinAFL will be released and a set of 0day vulnerabilities will be presented. \nDo you want to see how a small addition to HTTP-response can stop a large-scale DDoS attack or how a smart bitflipping can cause RCE in a sophisticated banking trojan?

This talk will explore the ever growing ride sharing economy and look at how the BLE \"Smart\" locks on shared bicycles work. The entire solution will be deconstructed and examined, from the mobile application to its supporting web services and finally communications with the lock. We will look at how to go about analysing communications between a mobile device and the lock, what works, what doesn't. \nPrevious talks on attacking BLE targeted the protocol itself using various hardware and software such as Ubertooth and Wireshark, which could be potentially difficult for someone new wanting to explore BLE and the ever connected IoT world.

      "description": "Two years ago Richard Thieme spoke on \u201cPlaying Through the Pain: The Impact of Dark Knowledge on Security and Intelligence Professionals\u201d for Def Con 24. He relied on dozens of experiences provided by colleagues over a quarter-century, colleagues from NSA, CIA, corporate, and military. Responses to the presentation have often been emotional and have corroborated his thesis. The real impact of this work on people over the long term has to be mitigated by counter-measures and strategies so scars can be endured or,even better,incorporated and put to use.\n\n\nIn this presentation, Thieme elaborates those strategies and counter-measures. In what is likely his final speech at Def Con, he speaks directly to the \u201chuman in the machine\u201d AS a human being. It\u2019s not about leaving the profession: it\u2019s about what we can do to thrive and transcend the challenges. It\u2018s about \u201csaving this space,\u201d this play space of hacking, work and life, and knowing the cost of being fully human while encountering dehumanizing impacts.\n\n\nIt is easier to focus on exploits, cool tools, zero days, and the games we play in the space that \u201cmakes us smile.\u201d It is not so easy to know how to play through the pain successfully. The damage to us does not show up in brain scans. It shows up in our families, our relationships, and our lives.\n\n\nThieme is not preaching, he is sharing insights based on what he too has had to transcend in his own life. They call a lot of us \u201csupernormals,\u201d which means we discovered resilient responses to deprivation, abuse, profound loss \u2026 or the daily challenges of work that makes clear that evil is real. We are driven, we never quit, we fight through adversity, we create and recreate personas that work, we do what has to be done. It pays to know how we do that and know THAT we know so we can recreate resilience in the face of whatever comes our way. \n\n\nA contractor for NSA suggested that everyone inside the agency should see the video of \u201cPlaying Through the Pain.\u201d A long-time Def Con attendee asks all new hires to watch \u201cStaring into the Abyss,\u201d a talk Thieme did a few years before. This subject matter is seldom discussed aloud \u201cout here\u201d and by all accounts is not taken seriously \u201cinside,\u201d which is perhaps why there have been half a dozen suicides lately at NSA and a CIA veteran said, \u201cI have 23 suicides on my mind, the most recent senior people who could not live with what they knew.\u201d\n\n\nThe assumption baked into this talk: real hacking, its ethos and its execution, provides the tools we need to do this damn thing right.\n\nThis talk is in honor of Perry Barlow and the EFF.",

This complication, being under-estimated or ignored by developers for a long time, has made our proposed attack vector possible, lethal, and general. Therefore, many 0days have been discovered via this approach in popular web frameworks written in trending programming languages, including Python, Ruby, Java, and JavaScript. \nBeing a very fundamental problem that exists in path normalization logic, sophisticated web frameworks can also suffer. For example, we've found various 0days on Java Spring Framework, Ruby on Rails, Next.js, and Python aiohttp, just to name a few. This general technique can also adapt to multi-layered web architecture, such as using Nginx or Apache as a proxy for Tomcat. In that case, reverse proxy protections can be bypassed. To make things worse, we're able to chain path normalization bugs to bypass authentication and achieve RCE in real world Bug Bounty Programs. Several scenarios will be demonstrated to illustrate how path normalization can be exploited to achieve sensitive information disclosure, SMB-Relay and RCE. \nUnderstanding the basics of this technique, the audience won't be surprised to know that more than 10 vulnerabilities have been found in sophisticated frameworks and multi-layered web architectures aforementioned via this technique.",

Many a malware has been generically thwarted thanks to the watchful eye of these products. \nHowever on macOS, firewalls are rather poorly understood. Apple's documentation surrounding it's network filter interfaces is rather lacking and all commercial macOS firewalls are closed source. \nThis talk aims to take a peek behind the proverbial curtain revealing how to both create and 'destroy' macOS firewalls. \nIn this talk, we'll first dive into what it takes to create an effective firewall for macOS. Yes we'll discuss core concepts such as kernel-level socket filtering\u2014but also how to communicate with user-mode components, install privileged code in a secure manner, and simple ways to implement self-defense mechanisms (including protecting the UI from synthetic events). \nOf course any security tool, including firewalls, can be broken. After looking at various macOS malware specimens that proactively attempt to detect such firewalls, we'll don our 'gray' (black?) hats to discuss various attacks against these products. And while some attacks are well known, others are currently undisclosed and can generically bypass even today's most vigilant Mac firewalls. \nBut all is not lost. By proactively discussing such attacks, combined with our newly-found understandings of firewall internals, we can improve the existing status quo, advancing firewall development. With a little luck, such advancements may foil, or at least complicate the lives of tomorrow's sophisticated Mac malware!",

Luckily security-conscious users will (hopefully) heed such warning dialogues\u2014stopping malicious code in its tracks. But what if such clicks can be synthetically generated and interact with such prompts in a completely invisible way? Well, then everything pretty much goes to hell. \nOf course OS vendors such as Apple are keenly aware of this 'attack' vector, and thus strive to design their UI in a manner that is resistant against synthetic events. Unfortunately they failed. \nIn this talk we'll discuss a vulnerability (CVE-2017-7150) found in all recent versions of macOS that allowed unprivileged code to interact with any UI component including 'protected' security dialogues. Armed with the bug, it was trivial to programmatically bypass Apple's touted 'User-Approved Kext' security feature, dump all passwords from the keychain, bypass 3rd-party security tools, and much more! And as Apple's patch was incomplete (surprise surprise) we'll drop an 0day that (still) allows unprivileged code to post synthetic events and bypass various security mechanisms on a fully patched macOS box! \nAnd while it may seem that such synthetic interactions with the UI will be visible to the user, we'll discuss an elegant way to ensure they happen completely invisibly!",

Typically, the most useful identifiers\u2014IP addresses, email address, domains, and so on\u2014are also the easiest things to spoof, obfuscate, or anonymise. Whilst more advanced techniques, such as correlating malicious activity with timezones, or linking attacks through the use of similar techniques or malware, can be useful, they tend to take investigators further away from the individuals responsible; at best, some inference about the country or specific actor group/collective can be made. \r\nIn this talk, I present a method for linking incidents to individual attackers with a high degree of accuracy, based on extremely fine-grained behavioural characteristics. This involves an investigatory technique known as \"case linkage analysis\" (CLA), which uses granular aspects of crime scene behaviours to link common offenders together through statistical comparison. It's been applied to some crime types before, but never to cyber attacks. \r\nI'll cover how CLA works, its advantages and disadvantages, and how it has previously been applied to a range of crimes, from burglary to homicide. I'll place it within the context of personality psychology, biometrics, forensic criminology, offender profiling, and forensic linguistics; and will walk through applying it practically. \r\nI'll then show the results of a novel experiment I conducted applying CLA to network intrusion attacks, which involved logging the keystrokes of volunteer attackers across different simulated intrusions, breaking these down into specific behaviours and syntax, and using these to link individuals to their offences. The end result: the way you type commands, including your choice and order of syntax, switches, and options, can form distinctive behavioural signatures, which can be used to link attackers together. Linking accuracy rates as high as 99% were achieved. \r\nFinally, I'll talk about the implications for both defenders and everyone else (particularly focusing on the privacy implications), explore ways in which these techniques could be defeated, and outline some ideas for future research in these areas.",

Due to its popularity, many attacks are proposed against this novel network model. In this talk, we further extend SDN attack surface and propose the Custom Attack, a novel attack against SDN networks that can cause serious security risks by exploiting legitimate SDN protocol messages. Unlike many attacks leverage misbehaved protocol interactions to incur unexpected controller events, we craft malicious protocol messages to exploit complex software vulnerabilities in SDN components. Our research shows that it was possible for a weak adversary to execute arbitrary command or manipulate data in the SDN controller without accessing the SDN controller or any applications, but only controlling a host or network switch.\n\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, Custom Attack is the first attack that can compromise multiple components of the SDN framework (e.g., User Interface, Database, Third-party libraries etc.). Till now we have tested 5 most popular SDN controllers and their applications and found all of them are vulnerable to Custom Attack in some degree.\n\n\n\nThis presentation will include:\n\n",

      "description": "The Teddy Ruxpin is an iconic toy from the 1980's featuring an animatronic teddy bear that reads stories from cassette tapes to children. In late 2017, a new model of the toy was released with improvements including Bluetooth connectivity, LCD eyes, and a companion mobile application. While the new bear features a number of improvements, the Teddy Ruxpin's original ability to add new stories by replacing the included cassettes is no longer applicable, and it requires users to supply files to the bear in a proprietary format. \nThis presentation aims to show how the new Teddy Ruxpin was reverse engineered down to a very low level in order to create new content. I will reveal the inner workings of the hardware and software within the bear and document the process used to reverse engineer it. I will then examine the communication between the mobile application and Teddy Ruxpin as well as the custom structure of the digital books read by the bear. I will end the presentation by releasing a toolset that allows users to create their own stories followed by a demo showcasing the Teddy Ruxpin greeting the DEF CON audience.",

The ETERNAL exploits, written by the Equation Group and dumped by the Shadow Brokers, have been used in the most damaging cyber attacks in computing history: WannaCry, NotPetya, Olympic Destroyer, and many others. \nYet, how these complicated exploits work has not been made clear to most. This is due to the ETERNAL exploits taking advantage of undocumented features of the Windows kernel and the esoteric SMBv1 protocol. \nThis talk will condense years of research into Windows internals and the SMBv1 protocol driver. Descriptions of full reverse engineering of internal structures and all historical background info needed to understand how the exploit chains for ETERNALBLUE, ETERNALCHAMPION, ETERNALROMANCE, and ETERNALSYNERGY work will be provided. \nThis talk will also describe how the MS17-010 patch fixed the vulnerabilities, and identify additional vulnerabilities that were patched around the same time.",

      "description": "Apple's sandbox was introduced as \"SeatBelt\" in macOS 10.5 which provided the first full-fledged implementation of the MACF policy. After a successful trial on macOS, Apple applied sandbox mechanism to iOS 6. In its implementation, the policy hooked dozens of operations. The number of hooks has been growing steadily when new system calls or newly discovered threats appeared. In the beginning, Apple's sandbox used a black list approach which means Apple originally concentrated on the known dangerous APIs and blocked them, allowing all others by default. However, with the evolution of Apple's sandbox, it applies a white list approach that denies all APIs and only allows secure ones that Apple trusts. \nIn this talk, we will first introduce Apple's sandbox mechanism and profiles in the latest iOS. Then, we discuss iOS IPC mechanism and review several old classic sandbox escape bugs. Most importantly, we show two new zero-day sandbox escape vulnerabilities we recently discovered in the latest iOS 11.4. Besides, we share our experience of exploiting vulnerabilities in system services through OOL msg heap spray and ROP (Return-oriented programming). In addition, we discuss a task port exploit technique which can be used to control the whole remote process through Mach messages. By using these techniques, security researchers could find and exploit sandbox escape bugs to control iOS user mode system services and further attack the kernel.",

      "description": "There are billions of ARM Cortex M based SOC being deployed in embedded systems.  Most of these devices are Internet ready and definitely security is always the main concern. Vendors would always apply security measurements into the ARM Cortex M product for few major reasons: 1) People will not be able to copy and replicate the product; 2) License control for the hardware and software; 3) Prevent malicious code injection in to the firmware. Vendors normally rely on the security measurements built within the chip (unique ID number/signature) or security measurements built around the chip (secure boot).\nIn this talk, we will share the ARM Cortex M SOC vulnerability that we discovered and it will be two parts:\nThe first is security measurement build within the SOC and how we break it. We could gain control of changing the SOC unique ID and write the firmware or even turn the device into a trojan or bot.\nThe second is security measure built around the SOC and how we break the Secure Boot elements and write into the firmware.",

      "description": "Orwell's concept of 1984 has more to do with government misuse of technology than technology itself. New technology allows for more opportunity, but unchecked, it allows for complete government control. \nRepresentative Daniel Zolnikov is the nation's leading politician regarding privacy and surveillance and has enacted numerous laws safeguarding fourth amendment rights regarding digital communications and technology. Daniel will walk you down the road of how political misuse of technology can and will turn the Federal Government into an unprecedented nanny state that will lead to a suppressed free flow of information and fear of stepping out of line. His story includes insights on how unique left and right coalitions were formed to pass these laws in his home state of Montana, and how he prevailed against law enforcement groups who opposed implementing warrant requirements. \nThis discussion is aimed at sharing insights no matter your political affiliation. All of Daniel's legislation has passed with overwhelming bi-partisan support through both bodies in Montana's legislature and was signed by the governor of the opposite party. Although most speeches involving politicians tend to lead towards rhetoric, Daniel's goal is to share enough information to be able to understand why change has not taken place yet, and leave you understanding how to remedy that. \nHis story will give you insights into the politics that states and the nation face when reforming these issues, and his down to earth approach will bring the topic down to a level of humor and easy understanding. There is no need for any technical or political insight to be able to appreciate this topic and the work Daniel has done on behalf of the more technologically savvy enthusiasts. \nThe theme of DEF CON 26 would be inconsistent without taking into consideration policy and how it ties in closely with technology. Technology relies on policy, and policy has the implications of dictating the use of technology. The two can go hand in hand, or end up squaring up against each other. You are an important, and lesser heard voice in the world of aged politicians with limited vision. The Orwellian state existed due to a mixture of bad policies and technology. Although the theme focuses on technology used to disrupt the surveillance state, the other half of the battle is ensuring this state does not reach the disastrous conclusions of 1984. \nDaniel believes we can move forward with technology without living in fear of our government. If you want to have some hope and direction towards the future of policy regarding surveillance and technology, Daniel will leave you with the optimism that there is still a chance that our nation can have a balanced approach that ensures 1984 does not become the norm in the future and will help you understand how to take part in this action.",

      "description": "Penetration testers can have the tables turned on them by attackers, to the detriment of client and tester security. Vulnerabilities exist in widely-used penetration testing tools and procedures. Testing often takes place in hostile environments: across the public Internet, over wireless, and on client networks where attackers may already have a foothold. \nIn these environments, common penetration testing practices can be targeted by third-party attackers. This can compromise testing teams in the style of \"ihuntpineapples\", or worse: quietly and over a long period of time. The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of client networks is also put at risk by \"sloppy\" testing techniques.\nIn this workshop, we present a comprehensive set of recommendations that can be used to build secure penetration testing operations. This includes technical recommendations, policies, procedures, and guidance on how to communicate and work with client organizations about the risks and mitigations. The goal is to develop testing practices that:\n- ...are more professionally sound\n\n - ...protect client organizations\n\n - ...protect penetration testers' infrastructure, and\n\n - ...avoid a negative impact on speed, agility, and creativity of testers\nThe recommendations are illustrated with entertaining and informative hands-on exercises. For the DEF CON 26 version of this class, the exercises have been updated to take place within Docker containers, and a portion of the class will involve introducing penetration testers to the use (and abuse) of containers. \nExercises include:\n\n - Vulnerability analysis of a penetration testing device's firmware\n\n - Quick and dirty code audits of high-risk testing tools\n\n - Monitoring and hijacking post-exploitation command and control\n\n - Layering security around otherwise insecure tools.\nAfter this workshop, you will walk away with actionable recommendations for improving the maturity and security of your penetration testing operations, as well as an exposure to the technical aspects of protecting the confidentiality of sensitive client data. You will participate in hands-on exercises that illustrate the importance of analyzing your own tools for vulnerabilities, and learn how to think like an attacker that hunts attackers. You'll hear about the challenges that are inherent in performing penetration tests on sensitive client networks, and learn how to layer security around your practices to reduce the risks.",

It captures, amplifies, and converts an optical signal from a visible or infrared light source into a digital form that can be analyzed or decoded with a computer. With OpticSpy, electronics hobbyists and hardware hackers can search for covert channels, which intentionally exfiltrate data in a way undetectable to the human eye, add data transfer functionality to a project, or explore signals from remote controls and other systems that send information through light waves. \nIn this workshop, creator Joe Grand will present a brief history of the project and then guide you through the process of building, calibrating, and testing your own kit version of OpticSpy.",

      "description": "Big Data have been for quiet a good time the driving force for innovation in many markets around. Data is the current asset that companies from around the world look for to crunch and extract information and knowledge, get new insights in order to create new services and products to deliver to their customers and finally improve their profits.\nBecause of that, it is imperative to protect such an important asset. In this workshop we will look at Haddoop from the point of view of security. We will learn what the Hadoop ecosystem has to offer us to protect our data, starting with Kerberos, perimeter security with Apache Knox, Configuring authorization with Apache Ranger and enabling encryption of the HDFS (Hadoop File System).\n1) Kerberos is used in Hadoop to provide an authentication system for users and other system interacting with the Hadoop cluster and it's services. Strongly authenticating and establishing a user's identity is the basis for secure access in Hadoop. Users need to be able to reliably \"identify\" themselves and then have that identity propagated throughout the Hadoop cluster. Hadoop uses Kerberos as the basis for strong authentication and identity propagation for both user and services. More info: https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/\n2) The Apache Knox Gateway (Knox) is a system to extend the reach of Apache Hadoop services to users outside of a Hadoop cluster without reducing Hadoop Security. Knox also simplifies Hadoop security for users who access the cluster data and execute jobs. The Knox Gateway is designed as a reverse proxy. The Apache Knox Gateway is an Application Gateway for interacting with the REST APIs and UIs of Apache Hadoop deployments. The Knox Gateway provides a single access point for all REST and HTTP interactions with Apache Hadoop clusters. More info: https://knox.apache.org/\n3) Apache Ranger is a framework to enable, monitor and manage comprehensive data security across the Hadoop platform. The vision with Ranger is to provide comprehensive security across the Apache Hadoop ecosystem",

In this 4 hour workshop we will learn the limitation of this enforcement and practice how we can bypass it. We will explore 4 different methods (from very easy to difficult) on various versions of Windows, including Windows 10. We will see how and why they work, and which malware used them in the past.\nFirst we will see how we can use leaked certificates to overcome DSE as well as how we can turn it OFF by design, and what are its limitations. Then we will use WinDBG to look into the kernel and find the various flags used to control DSE and use the HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver to do kernel exploitation for setting those to the value we require. We will use a simple dummy driver to demonstrate unsigned driver loading.",

      "description": "In recent years malscripts and file based exploits have become a main delivery method for malware. Malscripts are often heavily obfuscated and they can take many different forms including WScript, Javascript, macros, and PowerShell. There has also been been a rise in document based exploits used to deliver and execute these malscripts. As a result incident responders and malware analysts need to be comfortable analyzing different document formats, identifying potential exploits, and analyze malscripts.\nIn this workshop you will work through the triage of a live malware delivery chain that includes a malicious document, malicious scripts, and a final malware payload. During this process you will be exposed to different document based exploits, and you will practice the skills required to manually analyze malscripts. This workshop focuses on the fundamental analysis techniques used when identifying, deobfuscating, and analyzing maldocs and malscripts. However, we will also provide an introduction to automation tools and techniques that can be used to speed up the analysis process. \nThis workshop is aimed at junior incident responders, hobby malware analysts, and general security or IT practitioners who are interested in learning more about the malware triage process. If you have no experience with malware analysis but you have a good understanding of scripting languages like VBScript, and Javascript, and you are familiar with windows internals you should have no problem completing the workshop. You will be provided with a VirtualMachine to use during the workshop, please make sure to bring a laptop that meets the following requirements. Your laptop must have VirtualBox installed and working (VMWare is not supported). Your laptop must have at least 60GB of disk space free, preferably 100GB. Your laptop must be able to mount USB storage devices. Make sure you have the appropriate dongle if you need one.",

      "description": "As hackers, sometimes we need to send data without anybody knowing anything. We don't want anybody to know what we're sending, so we use encryption. That's the easy part. We also don't want anybody to know that we're sending any data. That's the hard part. The observation of our presence on the network could be enough to get us in trouble. And that's just not acceptable. We need to figure out a way to hide in plain sight.\nCreating an environment where data can be sent securely and our presence on the network is hidden, is not an easy thing to do. We can't rely on centralized technologies, which means we need to build a decentralized network. The network should be adaptive and flexible enough to send any type of data to any number of users. But how do we inject anonymity into a network while still supporting the verification of identity between parties? Can we establish trust without having to trust?\nThis workshop takes you through the process of creating a decentralized network that allows you to circumvent detection by governments and corporations. You'll be able to securely communicate and share data while masking your online identity. You'll create an adaptive, node-based infrastructure where data is shared via Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) backed by real-time asymmetric Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC). If you've ever wanted to punch a hole through a great (or not-so-great) firewall, this workshop is for you.\nPlease note that this is a medium-level, technical workshop and requires that attendees have prior experience in at least one programming language, preferably C or C++.

      "description": "It is common knowledge that automating security testing, especially for rapid-release applications is an essential requirement from multiple perspectives. One perspective is that of security testing in a Continuous Delivery Pipeline (as part of CI/CD) and the other is the perspective of a Penetration Tester. In a CI/CD Pipeline, one would like security tests to be triggered in an automated manner. These tests should provide information related to application vulnerabilities to engineering teams, early in the SDL (Software Development Lifecycle), preferably before these apps are deployed to production. From the perspective of the Pentester, there is the obvious shortage of time and resources. Pentesters spend a lot of time repeating standard manual processes, thereby losing out on time to perform more deep, insightful analysis of the target application to uncover serious security flaws. Targeted Automation, can be very useful for a Pentester as well.",

The input dataset is analyzed to collect various attributes which are then arranged in a number of feature vectors. These vectors are then individually visualized, indexed and then queried for each new input file. Matching vectors are labelled as per their AV detection categories for now but this could be changed to a heuristics approach if needed. If dynamic behavior or network traffic details are available, vectors are also converted into activity graphs that depict evolution of activity with a predefined time scale. This results into an animation of malware/malware category's behavior traits and is also useful in identifying activity overlaps across the input dataset.\n\n\nMalware detection is a challenging task as the landscape is ever-evolving. Every other day, a new variant or a known malware family is reported and signature driven tools race against time to add detection. The process worsens when the rate of incoming samples is in thousands on a daily basis, making static/dynamic analysis alone of no use.\n\n\nAngad tries to address this issue by leveraging well-known data classification techniques to the malware domain.

      "description": "Deception techniques - if deployed well - can be very effective for organizations to improve network defense and can be a useful arsenal for blue teams to detect attacks at very early stage of cyber kill chain. But the challenge we have seen is deploying, managing and administering decoys across large networks. Although there are lot of commercial tools in this space, we haven't come across open source tools which can achieve this.\n\n\nWith this in mind, we have developed DejaVu which is an open source deception framework which can be used to deploy, configure and administer decoys centrally across the infrastructure. A web-based management console can be used by the defender to deploy multiple interactive decoys (HTTP Servers,SQL,SMB,FTP,SSH,client side\u2013NBNS) strategically across their network on different VLANs. Logging and alerting dashboard displays detailed information about the alerts generated and can be further configured to generate high accuracy alert; and how these alerts should be handled.\n\n\nDecoys can also be placed on the client VLANs to detect client side attacks such as responder/LLMNR attacks using client side decoys. Additionally, common attacks which the adversary uses to compromise such as abusing Tomcat/SQL server for initial foothold can be deployed as decoys, luring the attacker and enabling detection.",

PA Toolkit contains plugins (both dissectors and taps) covering various scenarios for multiple protocols, including:\n\n\n\n\n- WiFi   (WiFi network summary, Detecting beacon, deauth floods, Evil twin etc.)\n\n\n- VoIP ( Overview of extensions, servers, Detecting invite flood, message flood, SIP auth bruteforcing, Decrypting encrypted VoIP conversation)\n\n\n-  HTTP (Listing all visited websites, downloaded files, streaming files, Detecting HTTP Tunnels)\n\n\n-  HTTPS (Listing all websites opened on HTTPS, Detecting self-signed certificates)\n\n\n-  ARP (MAC-IP table, Detect MAC spoofing and ARP poisoning)\n\n\n-  DNS (Listing DNS servers used and DNS resolution, Detecting DNS Tunnels)\n\n\n\n\nThe key advantage of using PA toolkit is that any user can check security related summary and detect common attacks just by running Wireshark. And, he can do this on the platform of his choice. Also, as the project is open source and written in newbie-friendly Lua language, one can easily extend existing plugins or reuse the code to write plugins of his own.",

The \"mapping\" functionality is sort of like nmap for wifi - it lists all wifi networks nearby, and under each network it lists all the clients connected to that network. The \"trigger\" functionality allows users to do things like \"if this device sends more than 10000 bytes in 30 seconds, do something\". It also includes a powerful Python plugin system that makes it simple to write plugins to do things like \"if I see an Apple device with a power level greater than -40dBm, deauth it\". If you want to do any sort of wifi recon/monitoring/hacking, trackerjacker will almost certainly make the job easier!",

Within this demo, will be presented how HID attacks can still be used by threat actors to compromise industrial air-gapped environments.\nWHID Injector was born from the need for a cheap and dedicated hardware that could be remotely controlled in order to conduct HID attacks. WHID's core is mainly an Atmega 32u4 (commonly used in many Arduino boards) and an ESP-12s (which provides the WiFi capabilities and is commonly used in IoT projects).\nNontheless, during the last months, a new hardware was under R&D (i.e. WHID-Elite). It replaces the Wi-Fi capabilities with a 2G baseband, which gives unlimited operational range.\n\nThis cute piece of hardware is perfect to be concealed into USB gadgets and used during engagements to get remote shell over an air-gapped environment. In practice, is the \"wet dream\" of any ICS Red Teamer out there.\n\nDuring the demo we will see in depth how WHID and WHID-Elite were designed and their functionalities. We will also look at which tools and techniques Blue Teams can use to detect and mitigate this kind of attacks.",

In that talk, I demonstrated how one can monitor a target by not following them directly, but by following their followers to and who they follow to get an idea of their social life without direct interaction. I felt bad for releasing a tool to enable potential stalkers, but not an antidote. This year's presentation IS that antidote. I will be discussing how we can uncover those stalkers that lie in the shadows.",

      "description": "In 2012 hackers were running rampant in Swedens federal mainframes. During the course of the investigation it was thought it might be a good idea to release *ALL* the investigation documentation to the public. Included in these public files were snippets (or full programs) of the tools the hackers developed to work on an IBM z/OS mainframe (see: https://wikileaks.org/gottfrid-docs/). But not every tool developed were included in those papers. Shortly after the documents were released, your speaker was sent a DM out of the blue with a link to a pastebin (https://pastebin.com/Apk5zWDj) and two simple questions: 'was this an exploit? how did it work?' Why did they contact the speaker? Because it was thought he originally was the one who did the breach. This talk will go over the breach in a high level before diving DEEP in to the unix part of a mainframe, looking at exactly what this C program was doing (or attempting to do) and how it accomplished it. This talks got it all when it comes to mainframe privilege escalation, APF authorized unix programs (a special attribute on z/OS),  buffer overflows, hijacking return addresses, debugging C programs and changing ACEEs. All of these will be peppered with demos to show how it worked. After this talk you'll be able to know exactly what DeFeNeStRaTe.C was (trying?) to do and see it in action!",

      "description": "     Surveillance had been a fact of life for sex workers wherever they have faced prohibition. Only two elements, communication and association, can differentiate between commercial and personal sex, criminal enforcement of prostitution laws have necessarily meant targeting the speech and affiliation of perceived sex workers. Enforcement of this nature is facilitated by profiling, institutional bias, and broad overreaching policies that fundamentally violate individual human rights. This has included condoms as evidence, non-consensual medical screenings, and targeted harassment of black transgender women as well as license plate recording projects and stings that focus disrupting immigration or migrant workers. \r\n     For all of its risks, screening potential clients is safer over email than it is in person during a street based negotiation often in an isolated part of town. SESTA (Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act) comes at a time when compelling research demonstrates that Craigslist resulted in a 17% drop in the female homicide rate. SESTA will also put victims at risk by delaying their identification and recovery by eliminating a digital paper trail. Additionally, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is a vital protection for a free internet. Subverting SESTA will create greater economic disparity between sex workers and ultimately empower pimps and agencies over independent  providers.",

As the public becomes more informed about cyber operations, it's only natural that malicious actors will increase their operational security by using new approaches or subverting existing detection tools. In fact, it's already begun. In order to remain relevant, security teams need to increase the data sets and tools at their disposal. \r\n\r\n     In this talk, we will focus on walking through various data sets \u2014 both commonly known and some newer approaches \u2014 in order to identify threat actors and their operations. We will put a focus on ongoing campaigns which have gone unnoticed and highlight additional ways to investigate more recent reported activity. We will also provide insight into how attackers are subverting these data sets and some ideas on how as defenders, we could improve coverage. Our talk will conclude with a brief discussion about future predictions and where defenders should be spending their time.",

I'll talk about what it was like to wield a surveillance system comprised of thousands of botted characters providing me with military-grade in-game intelligence. I'll outline the lessons I learned fighting off massive DDoS attacks on my own, including how I turned the laser on a mirror. I'll share a funny story about how serendipity convinced a forum that I had hacked them, as well as the the time I actually mass-hacked hundreds of users on a forum where child-porn was talked about with normalcy. I'll go into how CloudFlare doxxed me to that forum and how I hacked my way to the top of the situation without anyone being the wiser. After these and other tales, I hope you'll walk away from this talk laughing at my shenanigans while also having learned a few things about game development, hacking, and how to outmaneuver your opposition.",

      "description": "Automation has been the forefront of almost every tool or talk in the recent years. The DFIR industry has been moving rapidly towards automating everything! With some great work being done in the area of integrating workflows and various toolsets to make things easier for analysts, automation has really taken off. While that sounds like a worthwhile solution to help SOC analysts weed out the run of the mill adware/PUPs or phishing expeditions, can we really automate a response to the more sophisticated or targeted attack on our company\u2019s crown jewels?\r\n\r\nThe current argument being made, is that -- rather than building in house Incident Response teams, we should utilize automation to substitute analysts and use third party retainers for skilled analysis. Large investments in automation technologies, rather than resource development reflect this strategy. What does this mean for career progression for budding DFIR analysts? With security engineering taking the forefront, is analysis as a career in DFIR a dying star? Is automation moving us towards click forensics rather than intelligent analysis? I\u2019d like to challenge groupthink, and debate where automation will lead the industry trends. Additionally, I will share some of my experiences in the changing face of DFIR.",

Come hear from a diehard programmer and hacker who loves to break and loves to build, and learn how a regular programmer can make major contributions to security from the trenches. This presentation will dive into the intersection between development and security. You will learn about the SDL -- Secure Development Lifecycle, and why in the world a hacker would care about processes and procedures. You will learn how \"processes\" and \"lifecycles\" can be useful -- and how they can be a complete waste of time. Included are real world success stories of organizational hacking -- getting other engineers to change their practices -- and real world fail stories. Attendees will come away with knowledge of how development and security intersect, and how they can use their programming day job to save the world. If you are a developer who cares deeply about security, enjoys exploits, and wants to make the world a better place, this is for you.\r\n\r\n",

The volume of information and multiple sources to consume this information create interesting challenges for any security team. In the recent months several organizations have been prey of bad actors, exposing private data of millions of users, many times from month old vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nVulnerability management is often disregarded, improperly staffed and rarely discuss in the infosec community, yet is one of the single point of failures allowing for breaches to take place. Under this circumstance, are you prepared to deal with vulnerabilities accordingly?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll share our experiences dealing vulnerabilities at scale. What works, what does not and why. More importantly, what actions you should consider improving or build your Vulnerability program. In the process, we\u2019ll introduce some of the custom tools created internally to automate and enhance the program.\r\n\r\nUnlike most Vulnerability Management talks, this talk is about the hands-on portion and day-to- day activities that must take place.

      "description": "Industrial espionage is the practice of secretly gathering information about competing corporation or business interest, with the objective of placing one\u2019s own organization at a strategic or financial advantage. A common practice to achieve this advantage is to elicit information from unwitting individuals through what today is called social engineering (SE). We all hear the term SE so often that we become desensitized to it, thereby INCREASING the effectiveness of it against ourselves and organizations. Thus, will call it what it is - Human Intelligence, also known as HUMINT.\r\n\r\nPresenting personal experiences as an Army counterintelligence agent with examples of military and industrial espionage, will examine tradecraft employed against individuals every day. We will apply lessons learned from the US military and the intelligence community by using two acronyms taught to Army counterintelligence agents: SAEDA (Subversion and Espionage Directed against the Army) and MICE (Money, Ideology, Coercion, Ego). By presenting different aspects of HUMINT collection efforts will enable individuals to possibly detect, deflect, and protect oneself from such actions.\r\n\r\n",

As SOCs improve their capabilities by turning inwards, where should they start? What techniques should they be worried about? What tools will help them? Without knowing what your adversaries can do and what your current capabilities are, it\u2019s hard to make improvements.\r\n\r\nThis talk will describe how to use the MITRE ATT&CK framework as a \u201cscorecard\u201d within the SOC to understand and tune defensive capabilities, making it easier to answer these hard questions. We\u2019ll describe key use cases for how SOCs can use ATT&CK, covering hunting, threat intelligence, red teaming, and security engineering. To enable these use cases, we\u2019ll present a non-invasive technique to construct a detective coverage map that highlights the SOC\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, focusing on minimizing resource requirements while still providing usable results. To accompany this, we describe a process to create a remediation plan that provides the highest return on investment by orienting on the most relevant threats and prioritizing defensive improvements based on current coverage. Throughout the talk, we will provide real examples, making it easy for those in attendance to understand and replicate at home.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "There is a rising trend within Threat actors to find newer, more effective and stealthy ways to attack and gain persistence in a network. One way to achieve this is by abusing legitimate software such as Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell. This is the case for Living Off the Land and Fileless threats. By using these techniques, attackers can distribute their malicious code bypassing software whitelisting and avoid antivirus detection. A method to detect these threats is by monitoring endpoints activity. However, this option comes with many challenges that range from getting enough system\u2019s activity information to handle hundreds of events per second.\r\n\r\nIn our research, we analyze this monitoring method and the design challenges involved in it. Furthermore, we propose a solution that aims to detect and alert when advance threats are identified in a system. In order to provide an endpoint monitoring system free of any vendor lock-in, this solution combines the capabilities of different open source projects as well as free tools. These include, Sysmon for monitoring system activity, Elastic Stack (ELK) to store and search the collected data, ElastAlert to trigger alarms and the Sigma Project to define the rules for the alarms. This highly customizable solution would enable organizations to hunt for threats inside their network or create rules that would automatically detect specific threats upfront.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "SirenJack is a vulnerability that was found to affect radio-controlled emergency warning siren systems from ATI Systems. It allows a bad actor, with a $30 handheld radio and a laptop, to set off all sirens in a deployment. Hackers can trigger false alarms at will because the custom digital radio protocol does not implement encryption in vulnerable deployments. Emergency warning siren systems are public safety tools used to alert the population of incidents, such as weather and man-made threats. They are widely deployed in cities, industrial sites, military installations and educational institutions across the US and abroad. Sirens are often activated via a radio frequency (RF) communications system to provide coverage over a large area. Does the security of these RF-based systems match their status as critical infrastructure? The 2017 Dallas siren hack showed that many older siren systems are susceptible to replay attacks, but what about more modern ones? I studied San Francisco\u2019s Outdoor Public Warning System, an ATI deployment, for two years to learn how it was controlled. After piecing together clues on siren poles, and searching the entire radio spectrum for one unknown signal, I found the system\u2019s frequency and began passive analysis of the protocol. Monitoring the weekly siren tests, I made sense of patterns in the raw binary data and found the system was insecure and vulnerable to attack. This presentation will take you on the journey of the research, and detail the tools and techniques used, including leveraging Software Defined Radio and open source software to collect and analyse massive sets of RF data, and analyse a custom digital protocol. It will also cover the Responsible Disclosure process with the vendor, their response, and subsequent change to the protocol. A proof-of-concept will be shown for good measure.",

      "description": "North American railroads use several wireless systems for remote control, monitoring, and tracking of locomotives, railcars, signals, and other equipment. This talk will provide an overview of the systems in use, an in-depth look of two of them: The end-of-train (EOT) device contributed to the demise of the caboose 35 years ago, taking over one of its primary functions: monitoring brake pipe pressure. The EOT transmits pressure, its unique ID, and other data, encoded into AFSK packets, to a corresponding head-of-train (HOT) device in the locomotive. A secondary function is venting the line in an emergency braking event, under command of the HOT. BCH error correction is employed for reliability, but there are inherent security flaws. A SDR/GNU Radio/Python workflow for decoding and verifying packets will be demonstrated. Attempts at automatically identifying passing railcars were largely unsuccessful until the introduction of the Automatic Equipment Identification (AEI) system in the early 90s. This 900 MHz RFID system consists of passive tags on each locomotive and car and wayside readers at rail yard entrances and other locations of interest. The author's day job in environmental noise consulting led to a study of the feasibility of using AEI for rail noise studies. It had to be reverse-engineered first, of course. Using a repurposed commercial reader, Raspberry Pi, and cellular modem, a remote monitoring system gathered tag date for 5 weeks. Details of the protocol and monitoring system will be presented, along with video demonstrations.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "We present a scalable dynamic analysis framework that allows for the automatic evaluation of the privacy behaviors of Android apps. We use our system to analyze mobile apps' compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), one of the few stringent privacy laws in the U.S. Based on our automated analysis of 5,855 of the most popular free children's apps, we found that a majority are potentially in violation of COPPA, mainly due to their use of third-party SDKs. While many of these SDKs offer configuration options to respect COPPA by disabling tracking and behavioral advertising, our data suggest that a majority of apps either do not make use of these options or incorrectly propagate them across mediation SDKs. Worse, we observed that 19% of children's apps collect identifiers or other personally identifiable information (PII) via SDKs whose terms of service outright prohibit their use in child-directed apps. Finally, we show that efforts by Google to limit tracking through the use of a resettable advertising ID have had little success: of the 3,454 apps that share the resettable ID with advertisers, 66% transmit other, non-resettable, persistent identifiers as well, negating any intended privacy-preserving properties of the advertising ID.",

      "description": "In the Sixteenth Century, English Puritan preacher John Udal published a series of pamphlets criticizing the Anglican Church.  He signed the pamphlets under a pseudonym, Martin Marprelate.  The Bishops soon determined his identity, and Udal was sent to prison, where he died.  Such prosecutions for political views were common throughout in England throughout the Sixteenth, Seventeenth, and Eighteenth centuries.  \r\n\r\nSo it was not surprising that once the British colonies in America had achieved independence and were determining the future of their government, much of the debate occurred without real names.  When Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay published the Federalist Papers, they did so under a single pseudonym, Publius.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the First Amendment does not explicitly require anonymity, U.S. courts repeatedly have held that that its free speech protections guarantee a strong (but not absolute) right to speak anonymously. In 1960, the Supreme Court struck down a Los Angeles ordinance that prohibited the distribution of anonymous handbills, and it invalidated a similar Ohio law in 1995.  Since the mid \u201990s, state and federal courts have relied on this right to anonymity in rejecting defamation plaintiffs\u2019 attempts to use the court discovery process to unmask the identities of anonymous Internet posters.   Although the United States is not the only nation to protect anonymity, its anonymity protections are among the strongest in the world, and have helped establish the robust online debate that we know today.\r\n\r\nLegal and policy debates surrounding encryption often focus on privacy rights and the Fourth Amendment.  While these discussions are vital, that they too often overlook the free speech-based anonymity rights that have been fundamental to the United States since its founding.  In this presentation, I present the research conducted to date for my book-in-progress, United States of Anonymity, tracing the history of this First Amendment-based right to speak anonymously.  I explain how this strong history of ensuring the right to speak anonymously applies to the current encryption debates, as well as the distinct but related issue of anonymity tools such as Tor.  I argue that encryption and anonymity are essential for Twenty-First Century free speech, and explain how the legal protection of pamphleteers extends to encryption and anonymity. \r\n\r\nTo be sure, some efforts to weaken encryption may not necessarily threaten an individual\u2019s anonymity. And encryption is not the only protection for anonymity. However, there is significant overlap between the values underlying the First Amendment anonymity opinions and some justifications for encryption. Moreover, encryption has been an essential component of many of the most innovative anonymity tools (such as the techniques that newsrooms have adopted to receive anonymous tips). ",

As a secondary feature, this method enables distinguishing individual Tor circuits, which allows Cloudflare to assign reputation to circuits rather than IP addresses, therefore showing less CAPTCHA to humans.\r\nAdditionally, I will introduce an open-source plugin for the Caddy Web Server which allows website admins to enable Opportunistic Onion using an existing HTTPS certificate with a simple configuration, nullifying the need to purchase Extended Validation certificates.

      "description": "The online cryptography challenge that's been sometimes called by the mainstream \"the hardest puzzle on the internet\" and \"one of the greatest online mysteries\" certainly earned those titles. Though mostly completed now for some years, there's a number of valuable things to be learned from how they handled and presented cryptography for both the well-versed as well as the uninitiated. A staggering number of individuals found themselves trying to study cryptography for the first time because of the pull the puzzles had on anyone who came across them, and somehow despite a massive online undertaking to find the creators, the question of their identity remains unanswered now 6 years later. The strategies and the attitudes used in the creation of these challenges could teach us all something about how we approach cryptography teaching and study, as well as how modern approaches to privacy actually fare against interested threats.\r\n",

      "description": "Current schemes to protect user passwords like bcrypt, scrypt, and iterative hashing are insufficient to resist offline dictionary attacks when password databases are stolen. We present a modern cloud service, called Pythia, which protects passwords using a cryptographically keyed pseudorandom function (PRF). Unlike existing schemes like HMAC, Pythia permits key updates as a response to compromises. Key updates nullify stolen password digests, enable digests to be updated to the new key, and don't require users to change their passwords. The keystone of is a new cryptographic construction called a partially-oblivious PRF that provides these new features.\r\n\r\nPythia was originally unveiled at Usenix Security 2015. In 2018, a production implementation of Pythia was created and open sourced via GitHub by Virgil Security. In addition to a presenting the Pythia construction, and demonstrating it's unique security features and performance advantage over the state of the art, we will provide a live demonstration of Virgil Security's Pythia client tool from installation through protecting and checking passwords.\r\n",

Our data collection systems in Cliqz Browser and Extension which power our search engine[1], anti-tracking systems[2] are designed in a way that server cannot link that two messages are from the same user.\r\nBut if the user is fully anonymous, how can the system prevent an attacker\r\nfrom polluting the data collection?\r\n\r\nWe will showcase an efficient mechanism to block an attacker without compromising the privacy and anonymity of the users. \r\nThis system builds on top of Direct Anonymous Attestation, a proven cryptographic primitive to implement service rate-limiting in a scenario where messages between users and the service are sent anonymously and message unlinkability is to be preserved. \r\nRate-limiting constraints for a service are defined as an arbitrary mapping from every possible valid message to a 'rate-limiting tag' string, in such a way that the constraints can be enforced if the service never accepts more than one message from the same user with same tag. \r\nUnder this definition, we employ DAA protocol to enforce these 'message quotas' without being able to link user messages. If authorized, users receive credentials issued by the service. These can be used to sign messages with respect to a 'basename' string, in such a way that two signatures performed with the same credentials are unlinkable if and only if their basenames are different. By forcing the mentioned rate-limiting tag to be in the signature basename the rate-limiting constraints can be enforced. \r\nService will verify the signature according to the DAA protocol and accept the message if and only if the tag that maps to the rate-limiting \u2018basename\u2019 has still not been seen. \r\n\r\nWe present all components needed to build and deploy such protection on existing\r\ndata collection systems with little overhead.\r\n\r\nThis system which is running in production for Cliqz browser is however not limited to browsers or extensions, it has been implemented in a scenario where user code is running in a web browser, thanks to WebAssembly and asm.js.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.\tHuman-web Overview: https://gist.github.com/solso/423a1104a9e3c1e3b8d7c9ca14e885e5\r\n2.\tAnti-tracking: https://static.cliqz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Cliqz-Studie-Tracking-the-Trackers.pdf\r\n\r\n",

I\u2019ll then present the lessons we have learned from our prototype integrations into real-life protocols and applications (such as TLS, SSH, and VPN), and our experiments on a variety of devices, ranging from IoT devices, to cloud servers, to HSMs. I\u2019ll discuss the Open Quantum Safe project for PQC development, and related open-source forks of OpenSSL, OpenSSH, and OpenVPN that can be used to experiment with PQC today. I\u2019ll present a demo of a full (key exchange + authentication) PQC TLS 1.3 connection.\r\n\r\nThis work sheds lights on the practicality of PQC, encouraging early adoption and experimentation by the security community.",

It is a history is filled with mephitic adventures, quarter-truths, poor life choices, incontinence, and various forms of C2H6O. This year, we will connect our stacks to extract some of the most celebrated, exaggerated and entertaining moments in Hacker History through the interpretation of a group of well-trained participants. In the end, we will, again, crown the Drunkest Hacker in History and you, the audience, will rejoice! Hosted by c7five & jaku, if you like eating from an 80s candy cannon, \u201cCats\u201d the musical, and feats of strength, you won\u2019t want to miss the return of Drunk Hacker History!

Recently a major Cannabis POS provider found itself on the business end of a sophisticated digital attack not once, not twice, but thrice. Or maybe four times; Poor disclosure policy and a lack of transparency made it hard to tell. A large portion of all dispensaries in the country were forced to enter sales by paper, spreadsheet, or to close their doors temporarily when this software was crashed by attackers. Government contracts were lost. All eyes are on the industry right now and, given its precarious federal legal status, the next moves made will be crucial. What mightve actually happened? How far beyond the carefully prepared press releases can we see by using OSINT, Social Engineering, source code analysis,and some good ol fashioned scripting & hacking? What makes the Cannabis industry a hotbed for this kind of behavior? Lets umm....answer those questions!",

Recent advances in the human understanding of genomics have led to breakthroughs in our ability to hack plant genomes to create better and better plants. The analogic relationship between computer programming paradigms and the central dogma of molecular biology are very uncanny and even justify the use of the word \u201chacking\u201d when describing the selective breeding and administration of tailormade drugs to humans. Whether deleting genes or add genes, techniques have been developed that can modify the plant source code, this development can turn off or turn on programs in the plant that ultimately change the final chemistry of cannabis plants. The final chemistry of the plant can, therefore, be tailor-made to hack individual human metabolomes by design and to fix \u2018buggy\u2019 humans or human behaviors.",

CTFs are a great experience to learn more about security and test your skills, so join up in a team (or even by yourself) and compete for fun and prizes! Scan the network to find every device and exploit as many as you can over the weekend. The top three teams will be rewarded!\r\n\r\nZero-Day Contest - The Zero-Day contest is focused on the discovery and demonstration of new exploits (0-day vulnerabilities). This track relies on the judging of newly discovered attacks against connected embedded electronic devices. Devices that are eligible for the contest can be found at https://www.sohopelesslybroken.com/contests.php#0day and you can start submitting entries now! The winners who score the highest on their judged entries will be rewarded with cash prizes. Contestants will need to provide proof that they disclosed the vulnerability to the vendor.\r\n\r\nLocation: IOT Village\r\nHours: Friday 1000-1900, Saturday 1000-1900, Sunday 1000-1300\r\nTwitter: @SOHObroken\r\nWebsite: http://www.sohopelesslybroken.com",

We touch upon players & history behind regulation, extrapolate how legalizing today enables the U.S. to reopen and control the renegotiation of major trade treaties such as the WTO, then finally elucidate the knock-on effects with respect to individual security and self sovereignty.",

      "description": "Bug bounty programs are a hot topic these days. More and more companies are realizing the benefits of running a program, and researchers are jumping at the opportunity to grab some swag and make some extra cash from the bugs they find. Reporting security issues has never been as easy, open, and risk-free as it is right now. Everybody wins!\r\n\r\nThough that doesn\u2019t mean we should stop there. As researchers, we spend a lot of time doing the same menial tasks for each program: monitoring for new targets, checking for common issues, remembering just which flags you needed to pass to that tool (or even which tool is best for that job). We build new tools, hack together shell scripts, and generally make small incremental changes to our process. But surely there\u2019s a better approach?\r\n\r\nAre you sick of repeating the same tedious tasks over and over? Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have your own bug hunting machine? One that -\r\n\r\nIs always watching\r\nReacts as soon as a new target becomes available\r\nTakes care of those tedious repetitive steps for you\r\nMakes life easy when you want to integrate a new tool/workflow\r\nDoesn\u2019t cost the world to run, and trivially scales\r\nLeverages lessons and technologies battle tested in the dev world to improve your offensive capacity, capability and productivity\r\nMonitors your own infrastructure and reacts before hackers can (while saving you the cost of those Bug Bounty payouts in the meantime)\r\nWe call this approach Bug Bounty Hunting on Steroids. We will discuss our research and approach to building such a machine, sharing some of the lessons we learned along the way.\tx",

Most corporations are not effectively using the largest collection of targeting data that is available on the public internet and fail to build and refine data driven threat models using the information that our adversaries are using against us. Targeted User Analytics and Human Honeypots is a research project I am working on to identify and model targeting methods with the hope of tipping the scales in our favor to defend our networks, users and critical systems.\r\n\r\nLinkedIn is the largest collection of Business Social Networking data available to \u201a\u00c4\u00faunathenticated\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 persons on the public internet. With the right techniques this data can be mined to identify and enrich targets. The purpose of my talk is to present targeting techniques through a use case and to demonstrate the value of other enrichment methods involving data sets that are widely available or collected from corporate security tools. The end result is analytics that predict who will be targeted and why they are more likely to be compromised if they are targeted. This will allow for proactive action to be taken to defend users and our assets.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\nUsers are still the weakest link\r\nSeed files\r\nSample seed File terms & Query\r\nSearch Engine Query\r\nHarvest\r\nExternal Enrichment\r\nInternal Enrichment\r\nHuman Honeypots and Operationalizing Defenses\r\nThe Things that we can expect an adversary to do\r\nHow can we disrupt this targeting approach\r\nIndustry trends",

It\u2019s a meme that reads: \u201cWhat\u2019s your stripper name? It\u2019s the name of your first pet and the first street you lived on! Comment with your answers, and share with your friends!\u201d\r\n\r\nAre alarm bells going off in your head yet?\r\n\r\nSecurity-savvy internet browsers know to be on the lookout for the digital version of a mustached man in a trench coat, like emails selling discounted Viagra. But as you\u2019ve gotten smarter about avoiding these obvious bids for information, attackers and online marketers have gotten subtler to persuade you to divulge personal information. Every second, users willingly divulge sensitive information in comments on social media memes like the stripper name post because they don\u2019t see them as a threat.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Hannah Silvers \u2014 social engineer and SEO marketing content strategist \u2014brings the two worlds together. Using (hilarious) real-life examples, she will illustrate how social media memes are hotbeds of valuable PII for marketers and attackers alike, how these memes encourage users to engage with and share them, and the ways attackers can make use of them as an attack vector.\r\n\r\nOf course, the talk won\u2019t stop at the doom and gloom. The presenter will discuss implications to the work of security educators and what users can do to mitigate the risk these memes present once they understand how they work.",

      "description": "When attacking modern internal networks, intelligence is everything. Understanding the environment you are operating in can be the difference between successfully penetrating your target environment or missing targets of opportunity due to lack of understand about the target environment.\r\n\r\nWhile true, obtaining information about the environment in a stealthy manner, when required, can be difficult within a mature environment. Even during overt engagements, obtaining the information you need within a limited time window can be difficult, especially during engagement delays.\r\n\r\nFurther complicating things, often testing scope is based off of poor assumptions about the target environment, often leading unrealistic scope reductions a real-world attacker would not operate out of.\r\n\r\nOver the years internal testing engagements have been operating on various assumptions within switched networks, often driving engagement execution methods, but what if these assumptions were wrong? What if we could utilize the wasted time, even weeks in advance, between deployment and engagement execution, to take the time to understand the network? What if we could leverage the realities of modern networks and the things customers do to \u201a\u00c4\u00f2prepare\u2019 for an engagement (backups, security scans, etc.) through 100% passive methods, challenging your assumptions about the network?\r\n\r\nPrebellico is pre-engagement and post compromise intelligence gathering mechanism designed to gather as much information about the target environment through 100% passive methods. Utilizing very few resources, Prebellico permits an attacker the ability to understand the target environment by providing information such as the intent of internal systems, internal network address space, hostnames, egress filtering, TCP trust relationships, as well as map open TCP/UDP ports through reverse port scanning using 100% passive techniques.\u201d",

The US federal government alone produces tens of thousands of different forms that collect information on everything from the owner and location of every oil well in the country, to the VIN number of every car that\u2019s imported, the location and height of every cell phone tower, and much more. While most of this data is locked behind clunky 1990s-era search forms, or in exports of antiquated database formats, the enterprising researcher will find a treasure trove that exists outside the indexes of Google and LexisNexis.\r\n\r\nI have written scrapers and parsers for 100s of these databases and will share with you what I\u2019ve learned about coaxing OSINT out of some of the messiest and hard to find data out there.\r\n\r\nThe talk will specifically feature a deep dive into the data produced by the US Federal Communications Commission. The FCC has issued over 20 million licenses for transmitting on regulated parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. The data residue of this process can be used for everything from geo-locating electronic border surveillance infrastructure to discovering the location and transmission frequency of every McDonald\u2019s drive-thru radio. In the second portion of the talk, I will discuss how various protocols for data transmission can be decoded and joined with other contextual public data. For instance, every cargo ship emits an \u201c\u201cAutomated Identification System\u201d\u201d signal that can be joined with shipping records to understand what the ship is carrying.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, I hope attendees will develop new intuitions and techniques for finding and working with government data, and specifically have the tools to run their own investigations using FCC data.",

In doing so they often go out publicly on tender and / or issue an RFP/RFQ in order to obtain the best possible solution to meet their requirements and budget (usually cost wins).\r\n\r\nDue to this and a lack of maturity in the field, companies issue public RFQs / RFPs that contain classified and confidential / secret information such as network diagrams, architectural designs, software versions etc. This type of information would usually require that an attacker spend an extensive amount of time performing enumeration and / or gaining access to the internal network first and taking a significant amount of time to learn about that environment. Targeting the procurement process of an organisation exposes a largely unexplored attack surface.\r\n\r\nThis new research and presentation aims to demystify the above and give practical examples of large international organisations, which unfortunately fail at the RFP/RFQ process badly. This opens a \u201a\u00c4\u00fafree and easy\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 attack vector for attackers to exploit without even conducting extensive enumeration and fingerprinting, or anything close to intrusive attacks. As a result, an attacker often has access to an extensive amount confidential information about the organisation, which could be utilised to launch more targeted attacks. Depending on the type of information gathered, such attacks, could be likened to an attacker that has insider knowledge.\r\n\r\nI will also be demonstrating, via real world examples, the dangers of going out blindly and looking for specific services and products in the information security industry, with real life networks being shown on stage.\r\n\r\nA short breakdown of what will be presented is as follows:\r\n\r\nAn explanation of what is wrong with the RFQ/RFP process worldwide including proof of these issues.\r\nMultiple attack avenues of real hackers taking advantage of the process / information leaked.\r\nScenarios where attackers would be in an advantageous position.\r\nPersonal examples that I\u2019ve seen over the last 16 years (I\u2019ve contributed towards over 4000 responses to RFQs/RFPs over the years!).\r\nReal life examples that we\u2019ve seen and found publicly online, including private information that attackers could utilise.\r\nSome advice on solving this difficult issue.\u201d",

This chapter focuses on both Federal and Buenos Aires City Police, which according to the Head of Government Horacio Rodr\u00edguez Larreta, has the \u201cmost modern technology in the world\u201d.\r\n\r\nWe will analyze four particular cases (two on the lightning talk version), all of them ending in national scandals:\r\n\r\nThe leaking of the Police Reports database. Which led to the disclosure of private information of criminals, informants, involved police agents and even original reporters. This database contained cases related to drug trafficking and proxenetism.\r\nThe leaking of Proyecto X, a joined intelligence task force composed by members of different forces.\r\nThe leaking of the SNIC (Criminal Information National System), that led to the disclosure of intelligence information regarding criminal gangs undergoing federal investigation but not prosecuted/captured yet.\r\nThe leaking of Buenos Aires City Police entire database, that led to the disclosure of every agents personal information, including religious and health related concerns, like STDs, clinical and psychological history, and more.\r\n\r\nBut we\u2019ll do it having in mind a special requirement: passive action. We\u2019ll use Recon & OSINT at it\u2019s best in order to reconstruct how the leaks were carried from start to end. A police chief using his daughter\u2019s name as a password? A Police CIO using his own National ID Number as recovery question? Public databases exposing too much information? Reused passwords across every site on the internet? Sure, but it\u2019s not the worst. We\u2019ll use hand crafted DIY tools and without compromising a single system, reveal a lot of bugs and vulns. This talk is heavily focused on obtaining OSINT from public sources (specially in countries with weak or ambiguous laws, like Argentina)\r\n\r\nThis talk aims to demonstrate various flaws with a critical, technical and impartial approach to bring to the public a prevailing reality: First, argentine law allows a lot of compromising data to be used as \u201cpublic\u201d (thus leaving the place for OSINT based attacks to occur), and second\u2026 we are not safe against computer threats, and those who take care of us, neither are.",

      "description": "The hard science disciplines (computer science, electrical and computer engineering) have already started investing heavily in cybersecurity education. Security experts, however, note that cybersecurity is a wider discipline than simply the [technical] fields, and professionals with backgrounds [in] the social sciences \u2026 will be needed in the cyber workforce of the future. The relevance of incorporating social sciences into the cybersecurity domain has been acknowledged by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and the Department of Homeland Security. Social science disciplines, such as sociology, criminology/criminal justice, anthropology, political science, and psychology are particularly adept at unpacking the complex facets of human behavior and should therefore be leveraged for their contributions to the area of cybersecurity. Yet, the social science arena remains weak in cybersecurity training and education of the future cyber workforce.\r\n\r\nThis talk shares an educator\u2019s efforts to engage undergraduate students in a hands-on social engineering project across Fall 2017 and Spring 2018 semesters. It uses the experiential learning framework that promotes \u201clearning by doing\u201d. Specifically, this talk focuses on three sub-projects: (i) shoulder surfing where student teams competed against each other, (ii) laptop distraction, where student teams attempted to convince Temple University Computer Services employees to leave their laptops (designed for the class exercise) so that the students could remove a bogus \u2018intellectual property\u2019 file and place a fake \u2018malware\u2019 program on the employees\u2019 machines, and (iii) convince individuals on Temple University campus to take a selfie with team members and a funny prop.\r\n\r\nThe talk also offers a comparative analysis of these projects over the two semesters, sharing the experiences and challenges of both the students and this educator. It also details the issues about designing projects that follow university ethics standards, training students in human subjects research ethics, generating relevant rubrics, and how to evaluate student engagement and learning. To conclude, the educator shares these cases discussed to initiate dialog in the area of hands-on learning for social science students. Audience feedback is welcomed as this educator is still exploring the experiential learning approach, especially in the area of social engineering.",

But yet I was born in 1983, so surely that makes me a perfect fit for the DEF CON theme this year. Not enough? Ok, well how about the fact that I\u2019m currently using open source tools, techniques and methodologies to combat modern slavery, wildlife trafficking, terrorism and just about every serious organized crime the world is currently battling from a desk in the middle of the London financial district. Interested in hearing from a different viewpoint and perspective, then this is your talk. While you might not walk away with a new tool for your toolbox, you will gain an understanding into how the smallest contribution can end up the most profound and how combining open source resources can take on much bigger problems that you\u2019ve maybe never considered.\r\n\r\nDuring my talk, I will cover a few examples of recent Open Source investigations conducted by myself, including details regarding the methodologies and tools which were used. We actively follow the person not the digital fingerprint to begin to understand and put a face to some of the most prevalent and serious organized crimes facing the world today.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in the forces I knew what I was facing and had to deal with, as Head of Research at a FinTech company I never expected that transferring my skills would end up uncovering individuals within the financial industry who I\u2019ve had to report for terrorist activity, human trafficking, wildlife trafficking, drug smuggling, violent crime, fraud (international and domestic), revenge porn, and stalking.\r\n\r\nAnd while I\u2019m not here to save the world, I think we can all do a little bit to contribute to a counter-future in which the good guys are empowered by technology and the bad guys have nowhere to hide.",

      "description": "In this presentation, we will demonstrate how to build a machine learning model that uses a merged dataset combining cyber related contextual information with Bitcoin (BTC) transaction data. The model can be used by both private and public sectors security professionals, working in the cryptocurrency field, to deny business for certain BTC addresses or, build legal cases to return illegally stolen coins.\r\n\r\nTo build the dataset, we collected a list of BTC addresses involved in illegal activities. Using these addresses as a starting point, we navigated along the chain, and reconstructructed a cluster of connected \u201a\u00c4\u00fadirty\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 addresses. We used rules such as First-In-First-Out (FIFO) to label them. These labeling techniques can be used to tag certain BTC addresses that fall within this path as \u201a\u00c4\u00fadirty\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 addresses because they handled money acquired through illegal activities. We can then take this a step further and analyze the characteristic behavioral elements of these addresses. This behavioral analysis will allow us to determine the features representing this malicious behavior and use them within a machine learning model classifying new BTC addresses.\r\n\r\nOur model-building approach is based on a three part framework: The first part is to collect a set of BTC addresses and classify them as \u201a\u00c4\u00faclean\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 or \u201a\u00c4\u00fadirty\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to use them as our ground truth. The second part is to test the classification models using this dataset and propose decision metrics to optimally pick a model. In this part, we will also discuss ideas about how to compute expensive, but important features obtained from transaction data. In the third part, we will show how to use the obtained optimal model to predict if an address is \u201a\u00c4\u00fadirty\u201a\u00c4\u00f9. Finally, we will discuss our challenges when solving this problem and propose solutions to overcome them.",

Get an interactive and dynamic interface to detect and respond to botnets, hackers, and script kiddies on a platform that is powered by just 5v and costs less than $10. Everyday any point of presence on the internet can be faced with thousands of scans, exploit attempts, or malicious probes with almost no signature or notification to the end user. OpenPiMap offers the ability to detect and respond to malicious network traffic that would normally be ignored by traditional anti-virus or consumer firewalls.\r\n\r\nOpenPiMap is an open source Netflow protocol analyzer written entirely in Python3, Flask, Javascript, and SQLite that combines open source intelligence with home/SOHO networking and intrusion detection. Running on any version of a Raspberry Pi, Linux OS, or Windows, OpenPiMap consists of two parts: (1) Netflow collection service and (2) Database processing service. The NetFlow service does exactly what it sounds like, it listens on a specified port for Netflow v5 data and logs the data into a local SQL database. The second part is where the magic happens.\r\n\r\nAll of the traffic, both in and out of the network, is compared to dozens of the top IP blacklists for malicious patterns. Once identified, the malicious suspects are mapped, interrogated via Shodan\u2019s Python API for vulnerable services and ownership information, and then staged for exploitation if a readily available exploit exists. This processing is where the bridge between traditional netflow traffic analyzers and OpenPiMap split. There are plenty of free tools on the market to monitor incoming and outgoing connections, bandwidth utilization, and common port usage. However, none of the existing products leverage open source intelligence to the extent of OpenPiMap by providing you with the open ports and services, ownership information, ISP, geographic location, and publically available exploits for the incoming or outgoing IP addresses.\r\n\r\n",

The only other certainty is they will continue to come up with new ways to innovate. They have to blend in to succeed so how do they balance those two competing influences? More than just the inconvenience, at worst, of taking over simple I/IOT or the creepiness of your home webcam. We will begin by analyzing the attacks that have happened and how they worked. Then, we will build our own. I will walk through how an attacker doesn\u2019t just attack you, but can easily build a mass attack campaign to take over thousands. Once they do, I show how instead of that inconvenience, they can laterally take over the house and hop to steal interesting things like embarrassing photos, social security numbers, bank account information, intellectual property, and tax returns for profit. If you cannot keep them out what can you do? For starters, let\u2019s understand how they communicate including some unique ideas for protocols (Google Suite) and infrastructure (traditional smokescreen for non-attribution to re-purposing I/IoT devices). This is the attacker\u2019s vulnerability: They have to use your connectivity. Finding them on endpoints is fairly difficult because they have numerous ways to evade. But, on the wire\u2026 the options are limited to just blending in. This talk is aimed to provide something to both offense and defense. For offense, demonstration of basic (orientation of concepts) to novel approaches for traffic protocols and infrastructure. For defense, awareness of traffic patterns along with protocol analysis with experiential detail (wireshark) helps them learn to fish (no pun intended) for a lifetime instead of just eating for a day since none of this is static in real life.",

      "description": "Nematodes, often called \u201canti-worms\u201d or \u201cbeneficial worms\u201d, are a controversial topic. They involve exploiting the same vulnerabilities used by malicious worms, but, rather than installing malware or being used to form a botnet, nematodes attempt to disinfect and patch the vulnerable host. In some variants, nematodes also try to perform some kind of beneficial action, such as compressing files, or reporting illegal content to law enforcement. \r\nDespite being brought up a few times in previous talks and papers, nematodes remain largely on the fringes of the security community\u2019s consciousness. Perhaps part of the reason for this is the demise of traditional network worms \u2013 after all, it\u2019s not 2004 any more \u2013 and perhaps, for good reason, most people think the idea usually doesn\u2019t work in practice, or has significant legal implications. However, there has recently been a trend of wormable vulnerabilities which utilise rather different mediums \u2013 such as WiFi (Broadpwn), Bluetooth (BlueBorne), light (smart lightbulbs), RFID tags, and more - and, of course, a huge number of wormable vulnerabilities in a wide range of IoT devices. The rise of these, and the fact that IoT security issues are not easily resolvable with patching, antivirus solutions, and other security mechanisms, may make it worth re-opening the nematode debate. \r\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll consider whether it actually is worth doing so, given that we could be on the threshold of an era involving new and devastating types of worms. Along the way, I\u2019ll cover the history of nematodes and take a journey back in time with some 'digital paleovirology', starting with the murky history of Creeper, Reaper and PERVADE in the 1970s, then moving on to Brain and Denzuko in 1986; ADM and Max Vision in 1998; PolyPedo in 2001; the \u2018worm wars\u2019 of 2003-2004; and right up to the present day battles between IoT botnets such as Mirai with IoT nematodes such as Hajime and Brickerbot. \r\nI\u2019ll also cover the legal and ethical issues posed by nematodes; the challenges and benefits they can bring; and will present some demos of custom nematodes. These include custom-developed worms and corresponding nematodes for both a recent web application vulnerability and an IoT device, and an improved and updated alternative to the PolyPedo worm. I'll also discuss 'Antidote', an in-progress and experimental modular framework for deploying and configuring anti-worms based on recent exploits and attack techniques. Finally, I'll outline some ideas for future research in this area.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "Smart irrigation systems, a new IoT device which is aimed at saving water and money, have already been adopted by smart cities (e.g., Barcelona), agriculture, and the private sector around the world and will replace existing traditional irrigation systems in the next few years as part of the smart water grid revolution. Connected to the Internet (via Wi-Fi/GSM communication) and critical infrastructure (e.g., water reservoirs), they will become a new target for motivated hackers and attackers. In this talk, we present research that was conducted over the past year, in which we investigated and reversed engineered three of the 10 most sold commercial smart irrigation systems (GreenIQ, RainMachine, and BlueSpray). We analyzed their interfaces with weather forecast services, cloud servers, sensors, and C&C devices, and based on this analysis, we present novel attack vectors against smart irrigation systems. We demonstrate (in videos) the implementation of the attack vectors on commercial smart irrigation systems and show how each of them contains a critical security vulnerability which allows a motivated hacker to remotely gain complete control of the system by: (1) hijacking or (2) influencing the smart irrigation system\u2019s artificial intelligence. Finally, we talk about the damage that hackers can cause by performing attacks on smart irrigation systems and hypothesize whether the next generation of plumbers will use Kali Linux instead of a monkey wrench.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "Many IoT devices use an ARM Cortex-M based MCU and run some kind of RTOS/\"bare metal\" OS. In comparison to Linux-based firmwares it is a lot more difficult to modify the firmware. If you want to change the functionality you usually have the choice between rewriting the whole firmware yourself or do binary patching manually. In this talk we would like to demonstrate an easier method and show a step-by-step approach. \r\nYou will see how to get access to the firmware of different Xiaomi Cloud products like lightbulbs or smart home gateways. \r\nTheir IoT devices are unable to function fully without cloud connection. The connection to the cloud is protected by AES and a unique device key. Data generated by the devices gets uploaded to the cloud of the vendor (e.g. Logfiles, etc.). In May 2018 a subcontractor of Xiaomi, Lumi, denied EU-based users and their devices access to their cloud infrastructure due the GDPR. To become independent from the vendor the way to go might be to modify or replace the firmware in the device. \r\nFor that, we are not only using methods that require opening the devices but also methods which leave the devices intact. The Nexmon framework (by the SEEMOO Lab) is used to alter the firmware of the ARM-based IoT devices. \r\nThe modified firmware is then used to extract secrets which are needed to run the IoT devices with your own cloud software. It is also possible to easily implement completely new functions into the firmware using C code.",

CAN has served as a convenient punching bag for automotive security researches for a plethora of reasons, but all of the available analysis tools share a shortcoming. They invariably use a microcontroller with a built-in CAN peripheral that automatically takes care of the low-level (ISO layer 1 and 2) communication details, and ensures that the CAN peripheral plays nicely and behaves at those low levels. However, a good hardware hacker understands that the sole purpose of the electron is to be bent to our will, and breaking assumptions by making \u201cThat CANT happen!\u201d happen is a surefire way to find bugs. CANT is a (partial) CAN bus peripheral implemented in software that allows security researchers to exercise the electrical bus-level error handling capability of CAN devices. The ability to selectively attack specific ECUs in a manner that is not detectable by automotive IDS/IPS systems (see ICS-ALERT-17-209-01) is invaluable to automotive security researchers as more automakers integrate advanced security measures into their vehicles.",

Current machine learning systems, however, assume that training and test data follow the same, or similar, distributions, and do not consider active adversaries manipulating either distribution. Recent work has demonstrated that motivated adversaries can circumvent anomaly detection or classification models at test time through evasion attacks, or can inject well-crafted malicious instances into training data to induce errors in classification through poisoning attacks. In addition, by undermining the integrity of learning systems, the privacy of users\u2019 data can also be compromised. In this talk, I will describe my recent research on generating evasion attacks in adversarial environments. I will also provide some insights about how to leverage data properties, such as spatial consistency as potential detection approach against such adversarial attacks.",

While many different adversarial attack strategies have been proposed on image classification models, object detection pipelines have been much harder to break. In this talk, I propose a novel strategy to craft adversarial examples by solving a constrained optimization problem using an adversarial generator network. The approach is fast and scalable, requiring only a forward pass through our trained generator network to craft an adversarial sample. Unlike in many attack strategies, we show that the same trained generator is capable of attacking new images without explicitly optimizing on them. The attack is evaluate on a trained Faster R-CNN face detector on the cropped 300-W face dataset where it manages to reduce the number of detected faces to 0.5% of all originally detected faces. In a different experiment, also on 300-W,I demonstrate the robustness of our attack to a JPEG compression based defense typical JPEG compression level of 75% reduces the effectiveness of our attack from only 0.5% of detected faces to a modest 5.0%.",

With the rising demands for computational power and speed in machine learning, there is a growing need for hardware architectures optimized for deep learning and other machine learning models, specifically in tightly constrained edge based systems. Unfortunately, the modern fabless business model of manufacturing hardware, while economic, leads to deficiencies in security through the supply chain. In addition, the embedded, distributed, unsupervised, and physically exposed nature of edge devices would make various hardware or physical attacks on edge devices as critical threats. In this talk, I will first introduce the landscape of adversarial machine learning on the edge. I will discuss several new attacks on neural networks from the hardware or physical perspective. I will then present our method for inserting a backdoor into neural networks. Our method is distinct from prior attacks in that it was generated to neither alter the weights nor inputs of a neural network. But rather, it inserts a backdoor by altering the functionality of operations implemented by the network on those parameters during the production of the neural network.",

Adversarial at- tacks serve as an important surrogate to evaluate the robustness of deep learning models before they are deployed. However, most of existing adversarial attacks can only fool a black-box model with a low success rate. To address this issue, we propose a broad class of momentum-based iterative algorithms to boost adversarial attacks. By integrating the momentum term into the iterative process for attacks, our methods can stabilize update directions and escape from poor local maxima during the iterations, resulting in more transferable adversarial examples. To further improve the success rates for black-box attacks, we apply momentum iterative algorithms to an ensemble of models, and show that the adversarially trained models with a strong defense ability are also vulnerable to our black-box attacks. We hope that the proposed methods will serve as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of various deep models and defense methods.

      "description": "Bruce Hou and Wen Zhou, Tencent Security Platform Department\r\n\r\nState-of-the-art deep neural network classifiers are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples which are designed to mislead classifiers with a very small perturbation. However, the performance of black-box attacks (without knowledge of the model parameters) against deployed models always degrades significantly. In this paper, We propose a novel way of perturbations for adversarial examples to enable black-box transfer. We first show that maximizing distance between natural images and their adversarial examples in the intermediate feature maps can improve both white-box attacks (with knowledge of the model parameters) and black-box attacks. We also show that smooth regularization on adversarial perturbations enables transferring across models. Extensive experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods both in white-box and black-box attacks.\r\n\r\n",

Many have demonstrated that small adversarial perturbations can fool deep neural networks into incorrectly predicting a specified target with high confidence. Current work on fooling ASR systems have focused on white-box attacks, in which the model architecture and parameters are known. In this paper, we adopt a black-box approach to adversarial generation, combining the approaches of both genetic algorithms and gradient estimation to solve the task. We achieve a 89.25% targeted attack similarity after 3000 generations while maintaining 94.6% audio file similarity.",

Still, certain evidence exists only in memory, especially when dealing with malware or fileless attacks designed to stay completely in memory and avoid hitting the disk, exactly for the purposes of avoiding detection and analysis by forensic examiners. Memory forensics is a rapidly growing field, offering many free tools for RAM analysis to uncover important evidence and further the case quickly. As it turns out, these tools can also be applied to a cold drive. Due to OS features such as hibernation, paging and swap space, data from memory ends up being written to disk and survives even when the machine is powered down. In this session, the presenter will introduce the challenges faced when investigations rely solely on disk images, in cases where live memory had not been captured. The audience will then learn how investigators can still benefit from memory forensics in such cases. The presenter will give a full walkthrough of applying techniques, discuss their benefits and limitations, and show examples of results.",

Using common off-the-shelf hardware, it allows the user to create large, distributed storage solution for media streaming, data analysis, and other data and bandwidth intensive tasks, thus providing a nice alternative to create a data replication pool easily. It was acquired by Red Hat in 2011, and merged into Red Hat Storage server in 2012, while still available in the open source world. Gluster itself doesn't have a large vulnerabilities history, having only 6 vulnerabilities reported in the last 6 years (2 of them after being bought by Red Hat). In this talk, we'll focus on the latter two, releasing GEVAUDAN, an exploit for newcomers to the gluster world to learn about it's architecture and security, and the implicancies of proper access managament on replicated data systems. This is a talk for begginers from both fields: data replication schemas and exploits writing, so both fields will have a proper introductory section. A live demo will take place during the talk, and the public can actively participate.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "Mallet is an intercepting proxy for arbitrary protocols. More accurately, it is a framework for building proxies for arbitrary protocols. Mallet provides the basics required of all proxies: A way to receive the data, a way to send the data, and a user interface to intercept and edit the data. It builds on the Netty project, and as such has access to a large, well-tested suite of protocol implementations that can be used to transform a stream of bytes into useful, high-level protocol objects. This workshop will introduce attendees to Mallet, and show how to construct pipelines of arbitrary complexity, to successfully decode and intercept messages in various protocols, as well as automating modifications of the various messages. A basic familiarity with Java will enhance the delegate's understanding of what they are taught, but is not a requirement.",

This talk will explore strategies and tactics for developing security education based on employees' roles, access, and attack surface while designing not only for efficiency but also for effectiveness. By prioritizing the highest-risk teams, pooling teams to collaboratively threat-model, and contextualizing universal truths of security hygiene to those threat models, we can deliver training that leverages employees' roles, fosters retention via active participation, and eases the burden on trainers within the security team. Attendees will walk away with a roadmap for building scalable, contextual, and collaborative role-based employee security education within their organizations.",

      "description": "Data exfiltration through DNS typically relies on the use of DNS query fields to exfiltrate data via the attacker's DNS server. This approach has several shortcomings. The first is attribution, since attackers end up creating a trail back to their own infrastructure. The second is awareness, as DFIR analysts have made careful study of DNS fields as exfiltration vectors. The third is access, since companies are increasingly using DNS server whitelisting to prevent or alert on outgoing DNS queries to servers controlled by attackers. But what if data could be transferred using the target's own whitelisted DNS servers, without the communicating systems ever directly connecting to each other or a common endpoint? Even if the network boundary employed data whitelisting to block data exfiltration?\r\n\r\nThrough a combination of DNS queries and text-based steganography, we'll cover the methods used to transfer data across a network, hidden in plain sight, without direct connectivity between systems, while employing multiple levels of deception to avoid generating alerts as well as to mislead analysis attempts. The presentation will include a demonstration of PacketWhisper, a new tool written in Python, that automates all of these steps for you. PacketWhisper will be made available on GitHub to coincide with this session (https://github.com/TryCatchHCF).",

      "description": "Have you ever been asked 'what is the best way to protect against $ATTACK'? (usually shortly after $ATTACK makes headlines). Have you ever been challenged to provide the reasoning behind your suggestion? If you were in a room full of experts, would your reasoning hold up under scrutiny? When you discuss with your security-savvy peers, you're quickly come to a consensus on the 'best' control (!= device) to protect against $ATTACK. But do you know WHY it's the 'best'? The Target-Based Security Model is essentially a framework that breaks down attacks to their component level. This breakdown makes it easy to see what the 'best' security controls are - as well as alternative security controls that could also be applied. Its not so much something new, as it is a new way for the industry to communicate about security. In much the same way that the OSI model allows for developers to know they are talking about the same thing, a common security model allows security professionsals to communicate in a vendor-agnostic manner. Think of it as a translation tool for vendor-speak. In this talk we'll present the Target-Based Security model and discuss the following: how it came to be, what it is, and how to use it. And of course, we'll talk about how it can be used to make the world a better place - provided we all agree to use it.",

      "description": "In the last year or so, we have seen a massive increase in the value of cryptocurrencies and the emergence of hundreds of new coins and ICOs, getting millions of people into an investment frenzy. A lot of them being non-technical regular consumers that rushed to create new accounts in the most popular crypto exchanges like Coinbase or Bitstamp. Crypto exchanges are naturally appealing for attackers and have been targeted since as long as we can remember. However, since last year, they are also being targeted by Man-in-the-Browser (MITB) attacks. Malware families such as Zeus Panda, Ramnit and Trickbot are already aiming at websites such as Coinbase.com or Blockchain.info. In this talk, we will detail how these attacks work, from account takeover to moving out the coins to attacker-controlled wallets. We'll discuss current defenses e.g. multi-factor authentication or strong SSL encryption and why they are failing to mitigate this type of attacks.",

In practice, these acts enable transparency of the operations of government to the masses with relative ease. In reality, submitting FOI requests can be a cumbersome and frustrating process for citizens.\r\n\r\nFor two years now I have been hacking this human black box - finding out what you can/cannot ask for and more importantly how to ask for information and get it! Have you ever asked the government for a log file, Cisco IOS running config or Active Directory group policies? Do you ever wonder if a government employee would provide you with such information if you asked really really nicely? Let's find out together! For the past couple of years I have been performing various technology-focused FOI requests in an attempt to answer one simple argument: Can you utilize freedom of information to enumerate technical information from government agencies? I present my research, findings and results of multiple years of submitting FOIA requests to various USA and Australian government institutions including multiple intelligence agencies. We will discover the fun times and challenges when performing such requests.\r\n\r\nAttendees will gain practical knowledge about: what FOIA is, the caveats of FOIA, how you can utilize FOIA on red team engagements and other open source intelligence gathering activities and finally the results of my research in multiple requests to intelligence agencies.",

It has become a challenge for security teams to ensure parity is maintained between security controls that are available on premise, to those offered by the cloud provider. Typically, companies send a word document or excel sheet to get answers from cloud providers, however, this process is done only once and the review is point in time. In this talk, the attendees will learn about various methods of identifying security posture of the third-party cloud service using information available on Internet, how to use this information for performing cloud service review and improve their own cloud offerings. This can also supplement the tedious questionnaire process and provide an option to fast track the vendor reviews.",

To find out, I revisited bitsquatting. First I'll briefly introduce the key concepts required for understanding bitsquatting (including ASCII, DNS and HTTP, Internet infrastructure, and memory error scenarios). I'll show the tools and techniques used to identify and register over 30 newly identified bitsquat domains, monitor DNS and HTTP requests, and process, enrich, and investigate the data. Finally, I will discuss any observations gathered from the data, with a focus on regional trends, specific devices, and current events - and try and see if I could prove any correlation.\r\n\r\nIn the end, attendees should leave with knowledge of the prevalence of bitsquatting and how it has evolved since the phrase was coined 8 years ago, as well as a few techniques for analyzing bitsquatting data and drawing some interesting conclusions.",

      "description": "Deceptions use attackers' own tactics to force them to reveal themselves. Deception techniques are typically used inside the network once attackers have broken in. Once inside, attackers use credentials to move laterally. But before penetrating their target, attackers often study publicly available data to plan their attack. Can we assume that attackers continue to use public information once they've broken in? Could externally-planted deceptions expand our range of visibility on the adversary's activity? In this session, we will present research we conducted to answer these questions, and introduce a tool you can use to \"try it at home.\" We first took a deeper look at various OSINT resources-social media, paste sites, public code repositories, etc.-to refine our picture of the types of publicly-available data, attackers might use to further an attack. Then we planted various deceptive information. For example, on PasteBin we created a fake \"paste\" page containing a dump of fake credentials. On GitHub we created a fake repository of code containing \"accidental\" commits (git commit -am 'removed password'). Next, we paired these deceptions with relevant data and user objects within a simulated network environment. We then started monitoring and waited for an attacker to bite.",

However, when we check the method of APT groups, a single spear-phishing usually enough to gain a foothold on the network. Therefore, red teams are mostly focused on \"assume breach\" type of scenarios. In these scenarios, testers need to use a post-exploitation framework. Besides that, testers also need to hide the server-agent communication from NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection Systems). In this session, we will discuss one of the most famous post-exploitation tool, Empire's situation against payload-based anomaly detection systems. We will explain how to normalize Empire's traffic with polymorphic blending attack (PBA) method. We will also cover our tool, \"firstorder\" which is designed to evade anomaly-based detection systems. firstorder tool takes a traffic capture file of the network, tries to identify normal profile and configures Empire's listener in such way.",

Today's vehicles rely on key-fob control modules, to ensure the vehicle is accessible to authorized users only. While most traditional automobile key-fob systems have been shown to be insecure in the past, here comes a game changer. Instead of the regular key-fob system, some car owners will be able to access their vehicle by having their smartphone authenticates as a digital car key.In this talk, we will reveal the research and attacks for one of digital car keys system in the current market. By investigating how these features work, and how to exploit it through different possibles of attack vectors, we will demonstrate the security limitations of such system. By the end of this talk, the attendees will not only understand how to exploit these systems also which tools can be used to achieve our goals.",

A recent (2016) Johns Hopkins University market survey found 60 different models have been produced specifically for law enforcement use. Rapid adoption is fueling this meteoric increase in availability and utilization. Additionally, device manufactures are attempting to package more and more technology into these devices. This has caused a deficiency in local municipalities' skills and budget to accurately assess the attack surface and exposure to the organization. Furthermore, departmental policies and procedures governing the secure deployment of these devices is largely insufficient.\r\n\r\nAt DEF CON, we will be introducing tactics, techniques, and procedures to assess the security of these devices. We will cover attacks against the physical devices, RF components, smartphone app's, and desktop software. The capabilities demonstrated and discussed will encompass publicly and privately available technologies. Additionally, the talk will cover multiple products and vendors, shedding light on industry wide issues and trends. Finally, we will be releasing software to detect and track various devices and tie these issues into real world events.",

Due to lack of familiarity amongst most enterprises, most organizations are ill-equipped to monitor or detect these mysterious channels. This introduces a plethora of covert channels by which data could be exfiltrated, or malware to be infiltrated into the network. In this session we explore this new frontier by focusing on new methods of IoT protocol exploitation by revealing research conducted over the last 2 years. Detailed examples will be provided, as well as demo of a python tool for exploiting unused portions of protocol fields. From our research, we'll also reveal new methods of detecting aberrant behavior emanating to/from these devices gathered from our lab and real world testing.",

In many cases, physical gear can be expensive and limited in capability which can be prohibitive, especially in engagements where dead drops are required. However, with the skyrocketing popularity of microcontrollers and single board computers, that barrier has been reduced significantly and has created a host of new possibilities for everything from dead drops to wired and wireless network intrusion and analysis. gh057 will introduce some of the more popular options in this genre and some live demonstrations of their more fun uses. gh057 will demonstrate three devices he built to solve specific problems and that are based on these platforms: ATtiny85, ESP8266 / ES32, Raspberry Pi Finally, and as a bonus, gh057 will demonstrate a simple technique that uses Applescript and Bash that can be used to create a simple USB trojan and can be useful for end-user training.",
