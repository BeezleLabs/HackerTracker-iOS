Although PLCs were made robust to sustain tough environments, little care was taken to raise defenses against potential cyber threats. As a consequence, threats started pouring in and causing havoc. During this presentation I will talk about the architecture of a PLC and how it can be p0wned. There will be some live demonstration attacks against 3 different brands of PLCs (if the demo demons allow it, if not I will just show a video). Additionally, I will demonstrate two vulnerabilities I recently discovered, affecting the Rockwell MicroLogix 1400 series and the Schneider Modicon M221 controllers.",

      "description": "Recently, the inspection of huge traffic log is imposing a great burden on security analysts. Unfortunately, there have been few research efforts focusing on scalablility in analyzing very large PCAP file with reasonable computing resources. Asura is a portable and scalable PCAP file analyzer for detecting anomaly packets using massive multithreading. Asura's parallel packet dump inspection is based on task-based decomposition and therefore can handle massive threads for large PCAP file without considering tidy parameter selection in adopting data decomposition. Asura is designed to scale out in processing large PCAP file by taking as many threads as possible. \nAsura takes two steps. First, Asura extracts feature vector represented by associative containers of <sourceIP, destIP> pair. By doing this, the feature vector can be drastically small compared with the size of original PCAP files.  In other words, Asura can reduce packet dump data into the size of unique <sourceIP, destIP> pairs (for example, in experiment, Asura's output which is reduced in first step is about 2% compared with the size of original libpcap files). Second, a parallel clustering algorithm is applied for the feature vector which is represented as {<sourceIP, destIP>, V[i]} where V[i] is aggregated flow vector. In second step, Asura adopts an enhanced Kmeans algorithm. Concretely, two functions of Kmeans which are (1)calculating distance and (2)relabeling points are improved for parallel processing. \nIn experiment, in processing public PCAP datasets, Asura can identified 750 packets which are labeled as malicious from among 70 million (about 18GB) normal packets. In a nutshell, Asura successfully found 750 malicious packets in about 18GB packet dump. For Asura to inspect 70 million packets, it took reasonable computing time of around 350-450 minutes with 1000-5000 multithreading by running commodity workstation. Asura will be released under MIT license and available at author's GitHub site on the first day of DEF CON 26.",

Especially, as kernel's critical components, device drivers are frequently exploited to attack Apple systems. In fact, bug hunting in Apple kernel drivers is not easy since they are mostly closed-source and heavily relying on object-oriented programming. In this talk, we will share our experience of analyzing and attacking Apple kernel drivers. In specific, we will introduce a new tool called Ryuk. Ryuk employs static analysis techniques to discover bugs by itself or assist manual review. \nIn addition, we further combine static analysis with dynamic fuzzing for bug hunting in Apple drivers. In specific, we will introduce how we integrate Ryuk to the state-of-art Apple driver fuzzer, PassiveFuzzFrameworkOSX, for finding exploitable bugs. \n Most importantly, we will illustrate Ryuk's power with several new vulnerabilities that are recently discovered by Ryuk. In specific, we will show how we exploit these vulnerabilities for privilege escalation on macOS 10.13.3 and 10.13.2. We will not only explain why these bugs occur and how we find them, but also demonstrate how we exploit them with innovative kernel exploitation techniques.",

In the token transfer, the risk of replay attack cannot be completely avoided when the sender's signatures are abused, which can bring the loss to users. And the reason is that the applying scope of the signatures is not properly designed in the smart contracts. To test and verify this loophole, we selected two similar smart contracts for our experiment, at the same time, we used our own accounts in these two contracts to carry out the experiment. Because the same signatures of the two contracts were used in the experiment, we got a double income from sender successfully. The experiment verified that the replay attack is really exist. Besides, the replay attack may exist in multiple smart contracts. We calculated the number of smart contracts with this loophole, as well as the corresponding transaction activities, which find some Ethereum smart contracts are risked for this loophole. According to the vulnerability of the contract signature, the risk level is calibrated and depicted. Furthermore, the replay attack pattern is extended to within contract, cross contract and cross chain, which provide the pertinence and well reference for protection. Finally, the countermeasures are proposed to fix this vulnerability.",

For decades, fax machines were used worldwide as the main way of electronic document delivery. But this happened in the 1980s. Humanity has since developed far more advanced ways to send digital content, and fax machines are all in the past, right? After all, they should now be nothing more than a glorified museum item. Who on earth is still using fax machines? \nThe answer, to our great horror, is EVERYONE. State authorities, banks, service providers and many others are still using fax machines, despite their debatable quality and almost non-existent security. In fact, using fax machines is often mandatory and considered a solid and trustworthy method of delivering information. \nWhat the Fax?! We embarked on a journey with the singular goal of disrupting this insane state of affairs. We went to work, determined to show that the common fax machine could be compromised via mere access to its fully exposed and unprotected telephone line -- thus completely bypassing all perimeter security protections and shattering to pieces all modern-day security concepts. \nJoin us as we take you through the strange world of embedded operating systems, 30-year-old protocols, museum grade compression algorithms, weird extensions and undebuggable environments. See for yourself first-hand as we give a live demonstration of the first ever full fax exploitation, leading to complete control over the entire device as well as the network, using nothing but a standard telephone line. \nThis talk is intended to be the canary in the coal mine. The technology community cannot sit idly by while this ongoing madness is allowed to continue. The world must stop using FAX!",

We have found a bug inside this Android-SDK's component that relies in not properly setting the value of a variable used as an argument for localtime() function, when setting the \"Last Modified\" field for the Android App's files. Because of this, the time zone of anyone using the Android-SDK packager to generate their APKs is leaked. The curious thing is that, despite of this bug inside aapt, the problem goes even beyond aapt itself: its roots goes deep into an incorrect handling errors in the operative system functions localtime() (Windows) and localtime_r() (UNIX). \nBecause of in the world of Threat Intelligence determining the attacker's geographical location of is one of the most valuable data for attribution techniques, we focused our research in taking advantage of this bug for tracking Android malware developers. In addition to this, we have discovered another very effective way to find out the developer's time zone, based on a calculation of times extracting the GMT timestamp from the Android's app files and the UTC timestamp of the self-signed,\"disposable\" certificate added to the application (most common cases in malware developers). This is what we call: Rock appround the clock! Using these two different techniques, we have crunched some numbers with our 10 million apps database to determine how these leaked time zones (with one or another technique) are related with malware and which are the countries that generate more Android malicious applications, what is the possible relation between time zone and\"malware likelihood\" among other interesting numbers. \nBut that's not all, we have another bad news for malware developers: no IDE (even Android Studio) removes metadata from the files added to the Android app. We will show examples with real cases in which, after analyzing the metadata of files inside the .apk, we got to know country, language, or even more specific geographical location of the developer and -in some cases- the name of the suppose-to-be-anonymous developer! Finally, we will share the scripts we have built to get all this information with just a simple click.",

However, while the communication over Internet is routinely secured, there is still an area where such security awareness is not seen: inside individual computers, where adversaries are often not expected. \nThis talk discusses the security of various inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms that local processes and applications use to interact with each other. In particular, we show IPC-related vulnerabilities that allow a non-privileged process to steal passwords stored in popular password managers and even second factors from hardware tokens. With passwords being the primary way of authentication, the insecurity of this \"last mile\" causes the security of the rest of the communication strands to be obsolete. The vulnerabilities that we demonstrate can be exploited on multi-user computers that may have processes of multiple users running at the same time. The attacker is a non-privileged user trying to steal sensitive information from other users. Such computers can be found in enterprises with centralized access control that gives multiple users access to the same host. Computers with guest accounts and shared computers at home are similarly vulnerable.",

When you peer into their minds, these tools reveal their perilous implementations of PE file parsing. They assume PE files come as-is, but the Windows Loader actually applies many mutations (some at the command of the PE itself) before execution ever begins. This talk is about bending that loader to one's whim with the Relocations Table as a command spell. It will demonstrate how the loader can be instrumented into a mutation engine capable of transforming an utterly mangled PE file into a valid executable. This method starts with multiple ASLR Preselection attacks that force binary mapping at a predictable address. It then mangles the PE file, garbling any byte not required prior to relocation. Finally, it embeds a new Relocations Table which, when paired with a preselected base address, causes the loader to reconstruct the PE and execute it with ease. This isn't a packer or a POC, it is a PE rebuilder which generates completely valid, stable, and vastly tool-breaking executables. This talk will show you how this attack twists the protocols of a machine against the controls meant to protect it. It flexes on tools with various look-what-I-can-break demonstrations and, if you write similar tools, it'll make you rethink how you do it.",

Stepping away from the smart city fantasy, the reality is actually much more mundane. Many of these technologies have already quietly been deployed in cities across the world. In this talk, we examine the security of a cross-section of smart city devices currently in use today to reveal how deeply flawed they are and how the implications of these vulnerabilities could have serious consequences. \nIn addition to discussing newly discovered pre-auth attacks against multiple smart city devices from different categories of smart city technology, this presentation will discuss methods for how to figure out what smart city tech a given city is using, the privacy implications of smart cities, the implications of successful attacks on smart city tech, and what the future of smart city tech may hold.",

Recent advances in machine learning and text-to-speech have shown that synthetic, high-quality audio of subjects can be generated using transcripted speech from the target. Are current techniques for audio generation enough to spoof voice authentication algorithms? We demonstrate, using freely available machine learning models and limited budget, that standard speaker recognition and voice authentication systems are indeed fooled by targeted text-to-speech attacks.

Mobile Point of Sales (mPOS) terminals have propelled this growth lowering the barriers for small and micro-sized businesses to accept non-cash payments. Older payment technologies like mag-stripe still account for the largest majority of all in-person transactions. This is complicated further by the introduction of new payment standards such as NFC. As with each new iteration in payment technology, inevitably weaknesses are introduced into this increasingly complex payment eco-system. \nIn this talk, we ask, what are the security and fraud implications of removing the economic barriers to accepting card payments; and what are the risks associated with continued reliance on old card standards like mag-stripe? In the past, testing for payment attack vectors has been limited to the scope of individual projects and to those that have permanent access to POS and payment infrastructure. Not anymore! \nIn what we believe to be the most comprehensive research conducted in this area, we consider four of the major mPOS providers spread across the US and Europe; Square, SumUp, iZettle and Paypal. We provide live demonstrations of new vulnerabilities that allow you to MitM transactions, send arbitrary code via Bluetooth and mobile application, modify payment values for mag-stripe transactions, and a vulnerability in firmware; DoS to RCE. Using this sampled geographic approach, we are able to show the current attack surface of mPOS and, to predict how this will evolve over the coming years. \nFor audience members that are interested in integrating testing practices into their organization or research practices, we will show you how to use mPOS to identify weaknesses in payment technologies, and how to remain undetected in spite of anti-fraud and security mechanisms.",

In this Fireside Hax, we will challenge your assumptions about trolling. Trolls are attention hackers, using social and technical means to bait journalists, set agendas, game media gatekeepers, and direct audiences. Sometimes they also have fun. We will discuss a range of trolling techniques like sockpuppeting, dogpiling, doxing, attention honeypots, and cognitive denial of service attacks that we have not seen concisely catalogued elsewhere. We will also discuss high-profile examples of trolling such as\"training\" the Microsoft Tay chatbot, fake Antifa accounts, Russian sockpuppet accounts, and Phineas Fisher's use of Hacking Team's twitter account--and ask attendees to consider each as black hat attacks or grey hat attempts to point out critical societal vulnerabilities that should be\"patched.\" We will also talk about\"troll the troll\" accounts like ImposterBuster and YesYoureRacist and the role\"white hat trolls\" might play in auditing platforms or proposing platform-based controls. Time permitting, we will discuss art projects that trollishly critiqued the European Commission, Google AdSense, and the NSA. This will not be a lecture and it will not shy away from controversy. Join two members of the Media Manipulation Team at Data & Society to collectively consider the role trolling can play in pointing out the flaws in our attention/media landscape.",

It is becoming more and more difficult to remotely compromise Android phones especially Google\u2019s Pixel phone.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pixel phone is protected by many layers of security. It was the only device that was not pwned in the 2017 Mobile Pwn2Own competition. But our team discovered a remote exploit chain\u2014the first of its kind since the Android Security Rewards (ASR) program expansion, which could compromise The Pixel phone remotely. The exploit chain was reported to Android security team directly. They took it seriously and patched it quickly. Because of the severity and our detailed report, we were awarded the highest reward ($112,500) in the history of the ASR program.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will detail how we used the exploit chain to inject arbitrary code into system_server process and get system user permissions. The exploit chain includes two bugs, CVE-2017-5116 and CVE-2017-14904. CVE-2017-5116 is a V8 engine bug related with Webassembly and SharedArrayBuffer. It is used to get remote code execution in sandboxed Chrome render process. CVE-2017-14904 is a bug in Android's libgralloc module that is used to escape from the sandbox. The way we used for sandbox escaping is very interesting, rarely talked about before. All details of vulnerabilities and mitigation bypassing techniques will be given in this talk.",

      "description": "Although vulnerabilities stemming from the deserialization of untrusted data have been understood for many years, unsafe deserialization continues to be a vulnerability class that isn't going away. Attention on Java deserialization vulnerabilities skyrocketed in 2015 when Frohoff and Lawrence published an RCE gadget chain in the Apache Commons library and as recently as last year's Black Hat, Mu\u00f1oz and Miroshis presented a survey of dangerous JSON deserialization libraries. While much research and automated detection technology has so far focused on the discovery of vulnerable entry points (i.e. code that deserializes untrusted data), finding a \"gadget chain\" to actually make the vulnerability exploitable has thus far been a largely manual exercise. In this talk, I present a new technique for the automated discovery of deserialization gadget chains in Java, allowing defensive teams to quickly identify the significance of a deserialization vulnerability and allowing penetration testers to quickly develop working exploits. At the conclusion we will also be releasing a FOSS toolkit which utilizes this methodology and has been used to successfully develop many deserialization exploits in both internal applications and open source projects.",

This legacy technology, still implemented in nearly all popular HTTP surrogates (caching/load balancing services), is dangerous by design and brings a yet unexplored vector for web-based attacks. \nThe ESI language consists of a small set of instructions represented by XML tags, served by the backend application server, which are processed on the Edge servers (load balancers, reverse proxies). Due to the upstream-trusting nature of Edge servers, ESI engines are not able to distinguish between ESI instructions legitimately provided by the application server and malicious instructions injected by a malicious party. We identified that ESI can be used to perform SSRF, bypass reflected XSS filters (Chrome), and perform Javascript-less cookie theft, including HTTPOnly cookies. \nIdentified affected vendors include Akamai, Varnish, Squid, Fastly, WebSphere, WebLogic, F5, and countless language-specific solutions (NodeJS, Ruby, etc.). This presentation will start by introducing ESI and visiting typical infrastructures leveraging it. We will then delve into identification, exploitation of popular ESI engines, and mitigation.",

This means that the vulnerabilities are present even before the user enables wireless communications and starts installing third-party apps. To quantify the exposure of the Android end-users to vulnerabilities residing within pre-installed apps and firmware, we analyzed a wide range of Android vendors and carriers using devices spanning from low-end to flagship. Our primary focus was exposing pre-positioned threats on Android devices sold by United States (US) carriers, although our results affect devices worldwide. We will provide details of vulnerabilities in devices from all four major US carriers, as well two smaller US carriers, among others. The vulnerabilities we discovered on devices offered by the major US carriers are the following: arbitrary command execution as the system user, obtaining the modem logs and logcat logs, wiping all user data from a device (i.e., factory reset), obtaining and modifying a user\u2019s text messages, sending arbitrary text messages, and getting the phone numbers of the user\u2019s contacts, and more. All of the aforementioned capabilities are obtained outside of the normal Android permission model. Including both locked and unlocked devices, we provide details for 37 unique vulnerabilities affecting 25 Android devices with 11 of them being sold by US carriers. In this talk, we will present our framework that is capable of discovering 0-day vulnerabilities from binary firmware images and applications at scale allowing us to continuously monitor devices across different manufacturers and firmware versions. During the talk, we plan to perform a live demo of how our system works.",

While fuzzing has long been relied on by security researchers to identify software bugs, applying fuzzing methodologies to RF and hardware systems has historically been challenging due to siloed tools and the limited capabilities of commodity RF chipsets.\n\n\nWe created the TumbleRF fuzzing orchestration framework to address these shortfalls by defining core fuzzing logic while abstracting a hardware interface API that can be mapped for compatibility with any RF driver.  Thus, supporting a new radio involves merely extending an API, rather than writing a protocol-specific fuzzer from scratch.\n\n\nAdditionally, we introduce Orthrus, a low-cost 2.4 GHz offensive radio tool that provides PHY-layer mutability to offer Software Defined Radio-like features in a flexible and low-latency embedded form factor.  By combining the two, researchers will be able to fuzz and test RF protocols with greater depth and precision than ever before.\n\n\nAttendees can expect to leave this talk with an understanding of how RF and hardware physical layers actually work, and how to identify security issues that lie latent in these designs.",

      "description": "In 2017, FireEye conducted an incident response at a critical infrastructure facility where a sophisticated threat actor deployed the TRITON attack framework for implanting Safety Instrumented System (SIS) controllers with a passive backdoor, which would allow an attacker to inject potentially destructive payloads at a later point in time. TRITON is the most complex publicly known embedded system exploit to date. While the functionality of the malware is understood, little known about attacker efforts when developing such an implant. With a timeline of exploit development like TRITON being in a year range, complex embedded exploitation is currently considered to be a boutique hacking. However, the public release of much of the TRITON code can now facilitate less experienced threat actors with designing similar exploits. The goal of this talk is to provide the audience with a\"through the eyes of the attacker\" experience when designing advanced embedded systems exploits for Industrial Control Systems (ICS). This talk is based on our extensive experience in reverse engineering Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS)/firmwares and developing embedded exploits to cause physical damage. \nIn the first part of the talk we will explain how to convert an 'undocumented device' into malicious code. We will share how to purchase industrial equipment and obtain needed documentation. \nAfter obtaining control over an embedded system, an actual attack still need to be performed. In the second part of the talk will concentrate on discovering exploitable firmware and hardware design features which would allow an attacker to impact industrial controller functions. We will present several scenarios such as hijacking internal clock, suppressing interrupts (IRQ config attack) and manipulation of the interrupt vector table (IVT), CPU pin configuration attack and placing code into TCM cache so it would not be even visible in the memory. \nThe TRITON payload can be thought of as a four-stage shellcode. Attack code related to first three stages constituted a discussed backdoor implant capable of receiving and executing the fourth stage. This stage would have been an actual 'physical damage payload' performing the disruptive operations. However, the attacker was discovered while preparing the implant, before advancing to physical damage stage. In this part of the talk we will show how one can symbolically execute TRITON using ANGR framework and test a code for damage scenario written for any CPU/hardware architecture of choice. \nDeveloping embedded exploits requires a significant amount of effort but it is totally worth of investment. While a small fraction of asset owners is slowly embracing ICS network monitoring solutions, the attackers are going one layer lower\u2014into the control equipment (race-to-the-bottom). Developing embedded implants is worth the efforts due to lacking tools for detecting such implants and we will see more of advanced embedded exploitation in the nearest future. \nNote to reviewers: current abstract is too long and probably would need to be shortened if the application is selected for the presentation",

The testimony made national news when the group announced they could take down the Internet in 30 minutes. It was also the first-time hackers using handles appeared before a US Legislative body. \nMembers of the L0pht have grown from their hacker roots to become distinguished leaders and contributors in the security community and beyond. They run multi-million dollar security-focused organizations, have lobbied the government for better security laws, work for some of the largest companies in the world, and continue to spread the message of the positive aspects of hacking. \nWith several of the L0pht's original members, this discussion will cover the original testimony and the changes that have happened over the last 20 years. Is the government any more secure? Have they provided enough influence to help protect its citizens' data? What steps should we take to ensure user security and privacy in the future? We are hoping for audience participation and also welcome questions about any other time in the L0pht's relatively short, but poignant, existence.",

They can be found in universities, modern office buildings, sports arenas, and even high-end Las Vegas hotel rooms. If an environment has a lot of audio/video infrastructure, needs to interconnect or automate different IoT and building systems, or just wants the shades to close when the TV is turned on, chances are high that a Crestron device is controlling things from behind the scenes. And as these types of environments become the norm and grow ever more complex, the number of systems that Crestron devices are connected to grows as well. But it is in large part because of this complexity that installing and programming these devices is difficult enough without considering adding security. Instead of being a necessity, it's an extra headache that almost always gets entirely passed over. In this talk, I will take a look at different Crestron devices from a security perspective and discuss the many vulnerabilities and opportunities for fun to be found within. I will demonstrate both documented and undocumented features that can be used to achieve full system compromise and show the need to make securing these systems a priority, instead of an afterthought, in every deployment. In short, hijinx will ensue.",

      "description": "Typically, the activities of a malware attack occur on an execution timeline that generally consists of 3 segments\u2014the vector, the stage, and the persistence. First, a vector, or method of exploitation is identified. This could be anything from logging in over a credentialed method like RDP or SSH and running a malicious payload directly, to exploiting a memory corruption vulnerability remotely. Second, that access is leveraged into running malicious code that prepares the victim for the deployment of persistence (commonly \"implant\"). While segments one and three have been extensively automated, a effective automated utility for deploying persistence in a dynamic and unified context has yet to present itself. \nEnter the Genesis Scripting Engine. \nThe Genesis Scripting Engine, or Gscript for short, is a framework for building multi-tenant executors for several implants in a stager. The engine works by embedding runtime logic (powered by the V8 Javascript Virtual Machine) for each persistence technique. This logic gets run at deploy time on the victim machine, in parallel for every implant contained with the stager. The Gscript engine leverages the multi-platform support of Golang to produce final stage one binaries for Windows, Mac, and Linux. \nThis talk will consist of an overview of the origins of the project,  a technical deep dive into the inner workings including the modified Javascript VM, a walk through of the CLI utility, and examples of how we've leveraged Gscript in the real world. \nMultiple demos involving practical application scenarios will be presented, as well as an opportunity for audience members to submit their own implants and have them built into a hydra on stage in a matter of minutes.",

Therefore, hackers began to aim at another place, namely memory-level weakness, due to the breakages of critical system service itself. \nThis agenda will simply introduce a new memory injection technique that emerged after 2013, PowerLoadEx. Based on this concept,  three new injection methods will be disclosed as well. These makes good use of the memory vulnerability in Windows to inject malicious behavior into system critical services.

The activities to undermine the confidence in the 2016 presidential election have been well documented and the United States (U.S.) Government has assessed that our adversaries will apply lessons learned from the 2016 election and will continue in their attempts to influence the U.S. and their allies' upcoming elections, including the 2018 mid-term elections. As the lead agency for securing the Nation's cyber infrastructure, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a mission to maintain public trust and protect America's election systems.

Docker is used as a concrete example for the case study. A hacker can expect to leave this presentation with a practical exposure to multi-container application post-exploitation.",

The medical field is no exception; medical professionals rely upon technology to provide them with accurate information and base life-changing decisions on this data. \nIn recent years there has been more attention paid to the security of medical devices; however, there has been little research done on the unique protocols used by these devices. In large, health care systems medical personnel take advantage of to make decisions on patient treatment and other critical care, use central monitoring stations. This information is gathered from many devices on the network using uncommon networking protocols.  What if this information wasn't accurate when a doctor prescribed medication?  What if a patient was thought to be peacefully resting, when in fact they are under cardiac arrest? \nMcAfee's Advanced Threat Research team has discovered a weakness in the RWHAT protocol, one of the networking protocols used by medical devices to monitor a patient's condition.  This protocol is utilized in some of the most critical systems used in hospitals.  This weakness allows the data to be modified by an attacker in real-time to provide false information to medical personnel.   Lack of authentication also allows rogue devices to be placed onto the network and mimic patient monitors.   \nThis presentation will include a technical dissection of the security issues inherent in this relatively unknown protocol.  It will describe real-world attack scenarios and demonstrate the ability to modify the communications in-transit to directly influence the receiving devices.  We will also explore the general lack of security mitigations in the medical devices field, the risks they pose, and techniques to address them.  The talk will conclude with a demonstration using actual medical device hardware and a live modification of a patient's critical data.",

None of this matters as much as how administration is performed: Pop an admin, own the system. Admins are being dragged into a new paradigm where they have to more securely administer the environment. What does this mean for the pentester or Red Teamer? \nAdmins are gradually using better methods like two-factor and more secure administrative channels. Security is improving at many organizations, often quite rapidly. If we can quickly identify the way that administration is being performed, we can better highlight the flaws in the admin process. \nThis talk explores some common methods Active Directory administrators (and others) use to protect their admin credentials and the flaws with these approaches. New recon methods will be provided on how to identify if the org uses an AD Red Forest (aka Admin Forest) and what that means for one hired to test the organization's defenses, as well as how to successfully avoid the Red Forest and still be successful on an engagement.\nSome of the areas explored in this talk:\n\t",

A recent (2016) Johns Hopkins University market survey found 60 different models have been produced specifically for law enforcement use. Rapid adoption is fueling this meteoric increase in availability and utilization. Additionally, device manufactures are attempting to package more and more technology into these devices. This has caused a deficiency in local municipalities' skills and budget to accurately assess the attack surface and exposure to the organization. Furthermore, departmental policies and procedures governing the secure deployment of these devices is largely insufficient. \nAt DEF CON, we will be introducing tactics, techniques, and procedures to assess the security of these devices. We will cover attacks against the physical devices, RF components, smartphone app's, and desktop software. The capabilities demonstrated and discussed will encompass publicly and privately available technologies. Additionally, the talk will cover multiple products and vendors, shedding light on industry wide issues and trends.

In spite of how popular CRIME and BREACH were, little was talked about how this class of attacks was relevant to VPN networks. Compression oracle attacks are not limited to just TLS protected data. In this talk, we try these attacks on browser requests and responses which usually tunnel their HTTP traffic through VPNs. We also show a case study with a well-known VPN server and their plethora of clients. We then go into practical defenses and how mitigations in HTTP/2's HPACK and other mitigation techniques are the way forward rather than claiming 'Thou shall not compress traffic at all.' One of the things that we would like to showcase is how impedance mismatches in these different layers of technologies affect security and how they don't play well together.",

The bad news for game vendors is that these emulators are usually shipped with root permission in the first place. On the other hand, cheating tools developers are happy because they can easily distribute their tools to abusers without requiring the abusers to have a physical rooted device, nor do they need to perform laborious tuning for different Android OS / firmware version. However, luckily for game vendors, commercial Android emulators usually use an x86/ARM mixed-mode emulation for speed-up. As a result, a standard native hooking/DBI framework won't work on this kind of platform. This drawback could discourage the cheating developers. \nIn this talk, I will introduce a native hooking framework on such a kind of mixed-mode emulators. The talk will include the process start routine of both command-line applications and Android JNI applications as well as how these routines differ on an emulator. The different emulation strategies adopted by different emulators and runtime environments (Dalvik/ART) will also be discussed. Based on these knowledge, I will explain why the existing hooking/DBI frameworks do not work on these emulators and how to make one that works. \nLastly, I will present a demo of using this hooking framework to cheat a game on emulator. With this demo, I will discuss how the dark market of mobile game cheating may develop in the foreseeable future.",

These Wireless Industrial Sensor Networks (WISN) are used in process field device networks to monitor temperature, pressure, levels, flow or vibrations. The petrochemical industry uses WISN in oil and gas fields and plants around the world. \nBoth IEC ratified standards have been commonly praised by the ICS industry for their security features, including strong encryption on multiple layers within the protocol stack, resistance to RF interference, and replay protection. While the standards in general look safe on paper, there are potential interesting attack vectors that require verification. However, security research so far has not yielded any significant results beyond basic attack vectors. Often these attacks have only been theorized, and not (publically) demonstrated. In addition, vendor implementations have not been thoroughly tested for security by independent third parties, due to protocol complexity and the lack of proper (hardware/software) tools. We strongly believe in Wright's principle,\"Security does not improve until practical tools for exploration of the attack surface are made available.\"",

Hard coded database credentials in apps allowed access to all stored user locations. We would be able to extract hundreds of thousands of tracking profiles, even in real time. In others, this wasn't even necessary, because the user authentication could be bypassed altogether.

This OS is being used in Motorola devices, Zebra devices and Extreme network's devices. This research started focusing in an access point widely used in many Aircrafts by several worldwide airlines but ended up in something bigger in terms of devices affected as this embedded operating system is not only used in AP's for Aircrafts but also in Healthcare, Government, Transportation, Smart cities, small to big enterprises... and more. \nBased on public information, we will see how vulnerable devices are actively used (outdoors) in big cities around the world. But also in Universities, Hotels,Casinos, Big companies, Mines, Hospitals and provides the Wi-Fi access for places such as the New york City Subway. \nIn this presentation we will show with technical details how several critical vulnerabilities were found in this embedded OS. First we will introduce some internals and details about the OS and then we will show the techniques used to reverse engineering the mipsN32 ABI code for the Cavium Octeon processor. It will be discussed how some code was emulated to detect how a dynamic password is generated with a cryptographic algorithm for a root shell backdoor. Besides, it will be shown how some protocols used by some services were reverse engineered to find unauthenticated heap and stack overflow vulnerabilities that could be exploitable trough Wireless or Ethernet connection. \nThis OS also uses a proprietary layer 2/3 protocol called MiNT. This protocol is used for communication between WingOS devices through VLAN or IP. This protocol was also reverse engineered and remote heap/stack overflow vulnerabilities were found on services using this protocol and will be shown. As a live demonstration, 2 devices will be used to exploit a remote stack overflow chaining several vulnerabilities as the attacker could do inside an aircraft (or other scenarios) through the Wi-Fi. As there are not public shellcodes for mipsN32 ABI, the particularities of creating a Shellcode for mipsN32 ABI will be also discussed.",

Hidden behind this public face lurks some potentially dangerous issues which could lead to a compromise of data and privacy. \nLeveraging hundreds of minion devices, we built a public key reaping machine (which we are open sourcing) and operated it on a global scale. Collected keys are tested for vulnerabilities such as the recent ROCA vulnerability or factorization using batch-GCD. We've collected over 300 million keys so far and built a database 4 to 10 times bigger than previous public works. \nPerforming the initial computation on over 300 million keys took about 10 days on a 280 vCPU cluster. Many optimizations allow our tool to incrementally test new RSA keys for common prime factors against the whole dataset in just a few minutes. \nAs a result of our research, we could have impersonated hundreds of people by breaking their PGP keys, mimicked thousands of servers thanks to their factored SSH keys and performed MitM attacks on over 200k websites relying on vulnerable X509 certificates. \nIn the end, we were able to do this in an entirely passive way. Going further is possible, but it would lead us to the dark side. Would big brother hesitate to go there?",

Unfortunately what is currently available to the community is incredibly cost prohibitive or does not rise to the challenge. As malware authors and distributors share code and prepackaged tool kits, the corporate sponsored research community is dominated by solutions aimed at profit as opposed to augmenting capabilities available to the broader community. With that in mind, we are introducing our library for malware disassembly called Xori as an open source project. Xori is focused on helping reverse engineers analyze binaries, optimizing for time and effort spent per sample. \nXori is an automation-ready disassembly and static analysis library that consumes shellcode or PE binaries and provides triage analysis data. This Rust library emulates the stack, register states, and reference tables to identify suspicious functionality for manual analysis. Xori extracts structured data from binaries to use in machine learning and data science pipelines. \nWe will go over the pain-points of conventional open source disassemblers that Xori solves, examples of identifying suspicious functionality, and some of the interesting things we've done with the library.  We invite everyone in the community to use it, help contribute and make it an increasingly valuable tool for researchers alike.",

They have allowed for test case generation at a rate impossible by hand and the creation of test cases humans may never conceive of. While there are many excellent fuzzers available most are designed for mutating source files or input in random ways and attempting to discover edge cases in the handling of them. Some others are designed with structured input in mind and use grammars to more strategically generate and mutate possible inputs that adhere to the format defined. These specifically are the ones we care about for the goals of identifying differences between multiple implementations of a single language, finding bugs in parse tree generation/handling of tokens, and handling of the data at runtime once it has been successfully lexically and syntactically analyzed.

The development of 802.1x-2010 mitigates these issues by using MacSEC to provide Layer 2 encryption and packet integrity check to the protocol [5]. Since MacSEC encrypts data on a hop-by-hop basis, it successfully protects against the bridge-based attacks pioneered by the likes of Steve Riley, Abb, and Alva Duckwall [5][6]. \nIn addition to the development of 802.1x-2010, improved 802.1x support by peripheral devices such as printers also poses a challenge to attackers. Gone are the days in which bypassing 802.1x was as simple as finding a printer and spoofing address, as hardware manufacturers have gotten smarter. \nIn this talk, we will introduce a novel technique for bypassing 802.1x-2010 by demonstrating how MacSEC fails when weak forms of EAP are used. Additionally, we will discuss how improved 802.1x support by peripheral devices does not necessarily translate to improved port-security due to the widespread use of weak EAP. Finally, we will consider how improvements to the Linux kernel have made bridge-based techniques easier to implement and demonstrate an alternative to using packet injection for network interaction. We have packaged each of these techniques and improvements into an open source tool called Silent Bridge, which we plan on releasing at the conference.",

Several previous researches have demonstrated that such bugs exist and can be exploited. To find those bugs it would be reasonable to use coverage-guided fuzzing. \nThis talk aims to answer the following two questions: ___ we defend against malware by exploiting bugs in them ? How can we use fuzzing to find those bugs automatically ? \nThe author will show how we can apply coverage-guided fuzzing to automatically find bugs in sophisticated malicious samples such as botnet Mirai which was used to conduct one of the most destructive DDoS in history and various banking trojans.

      "description": "Two years ago Richard Thieme spoke on \u201cPlaying Through the Pain: The Impact of Dark Knowledge on Security and Intelligence Professionals\u201d for Def Con 24. He relied on dozens of experiences provided by colleagues over a quarter-century, colleagues from NSA, CIA, corporate, and military. Responses to the presentation have often been emotional and have corroborated his thesis. The real impact of this work on people over the long term has to be mitigated by counter-measures and strategies so scars can be endured or,even better,incorporated and put to use.\n\n\nIn this presentation, Thieme elaborates those strategies and counter-measures. In what is likely his final speech at Def Con, he speaks directly to the \u201chuman in the machine\u201d AS a human being. It\u2019s not about leaving the profession: it\u2019s about what we can do to thrive and transcend the challenges. It\u2018s about \u201csaving this space,\u201d this play space of hacking, work and life, and knowing the cost of being fully human while encountering dehumanizing impacts.\n\n\nIt is easier to focus on exploits, cool tools, zero days, and the games we play in the space that \u201cmakes us smile.\u201d It is not so easy to know how to play through the pain successfully. The damage to us does not show up in brain scans. It shows up in our families, our relationships, and our lives.\n\n\nThieme is not preaching, he is sharing insights based on what he too has had to transcend in his own life. They call a lot of us \u201csupernormals,\u201d which means we discovered resilient responses to deprivation, abuse, profound loss \u2026 or the daily challenges of work that makes clear that evil is real. We are driven, we never quit, we fight through adversity, we create and recreate personas that work, we do what has to be done. It pays to know how we do that and know THAT we know so we can recreate resilience in the face of whatever comes our way. \n\n\nA contractor for NSA suggested that everyone inside the agency should see the video of \u201cPlaying Through the Pain.\u201d A long-time Def Con attendee asks all new hires to watch \u201cStaring into the Abyss,\u201d a talk Thieme did a few years before. This subject matter is seldom discussed aloud \u201cout here\u201d and by all accounts is not taken seriously \u201cinside,\u201d which is perhaps why there have been half a dozen suicides lately at NSA and a CIA veteran said, \u201cI have 23 suicides on my mind, the most recent senior people who could not live with what they knew.\u201d\n\n\nThe assumption baked into this talk: real hacking, its ethos and its execution, provides the tools we need to do this damn thing right.\n\nThis talk is in honor of Perry Barlow and the EFF.",

This complication, being under-estimated or ignored by developers for a long time, has made our proposed attack vector possible, lethal, and general. Therefore, many 0days have been discovered via this approach in popular web frameworks written in trending programming languages, including Python, Ruby, Java, and JavaScript. \nBeing a very fundamental problem that exists in path normalization logic, sophisticated web frameworks can also suffer. For example, we've found various 0days on Java Spring Framework, Ruby on Rails, Next.js, and Python aiohttp, just to name a few. This general technique can also adapt to multi-layered web architecture, such as using Nginx or Apache as a proxy for Tomcat. In that case, reverse proxy protections can be bypassed. To make things worse, we're able to chain path normalization bugs to bypass authentication and achieve RCE in real world Bug Bounty Programs. Several scenarios will be demonstrated to illustrate how path normalization can be exploited to achieve sensitive information disclosure, SMB-Relay and RCE. \nUnderstanding the basics of this technique, the audience won't be surprised to know that more than 10 vulnerabilities have been found in sophisticated frameworks and multi-layered web architectures aforementioned via this technique.",

Many a malware has been generically thwarted thanks to the watchful eye of these products. \nHowever on macOS, firewalls are rather poorly understood. Apple's documentation surrounding it's network filter interfaces is rather lacking and all commercial macOS firewalls are closed source. \nThis talk aims to take a peek behind the proverbial curtain revealing how to both create and 'destroy' macOS firewalls. \nIn this talk, we'll first dive into what it takes to create an effective firewall for macOS. Yes we'll discuss core concepts such as kernel-level socket filtering\u2014but also how to communicate with user-mode components, install privileged code in a secure manner, and simple ways to implement self-defense mechanisms (including protecting the UI from synthetic events). \nOf course any security tool, including firewalls, can be broken. After looking at various macOS malware specimens that proactively attempt to detect such firewalls, we'll don our 'gray' (black?) hats to discuss various attacks against these products. And while some attacks are well known, others are currently undisclosed and can generically bypass even today's most vigilant Mac firewalls. \nBut all is not lost. By proactively discussing such attacks, combined with our newly-found understandings of firewall internals, we can improve the existing status quo, advancing firewall development. With a little luck, such advancements may foil, or at least complicate the lives of tomorrow's sophisticated Mac malware!",

Luckily security-conscious users will (hopefully) heed such warning dialogues\u2014stopping malicious code in its tracks. But what if such clicks can be synthetically generated and interact with such prompts in a completely invisible way? Well, then everything pretty much goes to hell. \nOf course OS vendors such as Apple are keenly aware of this 'attack' vector, and thus strive to design their UI in a manner that is resistant against synthetic events. Unfortunately they failed. \nIn this talk we'll discuss a vulnerability (CVE-2017-7150) found in all recent versions of macOS that allowed unprivileged code to interact with any UI component including 'protected' security dialogues. Armed with the bug, it was trivial to programmatically bypass Apple's touted 'User-Approved Kext' security feature, dump all passwords from the keychain, bypass 3rd-party security tools, and much more! And as Apple's patch was incomplete (surprise surprise) we'll drop an 0day that (still) allows unprivileged code to post synthetic events and bypass various security mechanisms on a fully patched macOS box! \nAnd while it may seem that such synthetic interactions with the UI will be visible to the user, we'll discuss an elegant way to ensure they happen completely invisibly!",

Typically, the most useful identifiers\u2014IP addresses, email address, domains, and so on\u2014are also the easiest things to spoof, obfuscate, or anonymise. Whilst more advanced techniques, such as correlating malicious activity with timezones, or linking attacks through the use of similar techniques or malware, can be useful, they tend to take investigators further away from the individuals responsible; at best, some inference about the country or specific actor group/collective can be made. \r\nIn this talk, I present a method for linking incidents to individual attackers with a high degree of accuracy, based on extremely fine-grained behavioural characteristics. This involves an investigatory technique known as \"case linkage analysis\" (CLA), which uses granular aspects of crime scene behaviours to link common offenders together through statistical comparison. It's been applied to some crime types before, but never to cyber attacks. \r\nI'll cover how CLA works, its advantages and disadvantages, and how it has previously been applied to a range of crimes, from burglary to homicide. I'll place it within the context of personality psychology, biometrics, forensic criminology, offender profiling, and forensic linguistics; and will walk through applying it practically. \r\nI'll then show the results of a novel experiment I conducted applying CLA to network intrusion attacks, which involved logging the keystrokes of volunteer attackers across different simulated intrusions, breaking these down into specific behaviours and syntax, and using these to link individuals to their offences. The end result: the way you type commands, including your choice and order of syntax, switches, and options, can form distinctive behavioural signatures, which can be used to link attackers together. Linking accuracy rates as high as 99% were achieved. \r\nFinally, I'll talk about the implications for both defenders and everyone else (particularly focusing on the privacy implications), explore ways in which these techniques could be defeated, and outline some ideas for future research in these areas.",

Unlike many attacks leverage misbehaved protocol interactions to incur unexpected controller events, we craft malicious protocol messages to exploit complex software vulnerabilities in SDN components. Our research shows that it was possible for a weak adversary to execute arbitrary command or manipulate data in the SDN controller without accessing the SDN controller or any applications, but only controlling a host or network switch.\n\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, Custom Attack is the first attack that can compromise multiple components of the SDN framework (e.g., User Interface, Database, Third-party libraries etc.).

While the new bear features a number of improvements, the Teddy Ruxpin's original ability to add new stories by replacing the included cassettes is no longer applicable, and it requires users to supply files to the bear in a proprietary format. \nThis presentation aims to show how the new Teddy Ruxpin was reverse engineered down to a very low level in order to create new content. I will reveal the inner workings of the hardware and software within the bear and document the process used to reverse engineer it. I will then examine the communication between the mobile application and Teddy Ruxpin as well as the custom structure of the digital books read by the bear. I will end the presentation by releasing a toolset that allows users to create their own stories followed by a demo showcasing the Teddy Ruxpin greeting the DEF CON audience.",

The ETERNAL exploits, written by the Equation Group and dumped by the Shadow Brokers, have been used in the most damaging cyber attacks in computing history: WannaCry, NotPetya, Olympic Destroyer, and many others. \nYet, how these complicated exploits work has not been made clear to most. This is due to the ETERNAL exploits taking advantage of undocumented features of the Windows kernel and the esoteric SMBv1 protocol. \nThis talk will condense years of research into Windows internals and the SMBv1 protocol driver. Descriptions of full reverse engineering of internal structures and all historical background info needed to understand how the exploit chains for ETERNALBLUE, ETERNALCHAMPION, ETERNALROMANCE, and ETERNALSYNERGY work will be provided. \nThis talk will also describe how the MS17-010 patch fixed the vulnerabilities, and identify additional vulnerabilities that were patched around the same time.",

      "description": "Apple's sandbox was introduced as \"SeatBelt\" in macOS 10.5 which provided the first full-fledged implementation of the MACF policy. After a successful trial on macOS, Apple applied sandbox mechanism to iOS 6. In its implementation, the policy hooked dozens of operations. The number of hooks has been growing steadily when new system calls or newly discovered threats appeared. In the beginning, Apple's sandbox used a black list approach which means Apple originally concentrated on the known dangerous APIs and blocked them, allowing all others by default. However, with the evolution of Apple's sandbox, it applies a white list approach that denies all APIs and only allows secure ones that Apple trusts. \nIn this talk, we will first introduce Apple's sandbox mechanism and profiles in the latest iOS. Then, we discuss iOS IPC mechanism and review several old classic sandbox escape bugs. Most importantly, we show two new zero-day sandbox escape vulnerabilities we recently discovered in the latest iOS 11.4. Besides, we share our experience of exploiting vulnerabilities in system services through OOL msg heap spray and ROP (Return-oriented programming). In addition, we discuss a task port exploit technique which can be used to control the whole remote process through Mach messages. By using these techniques, security researchers could find and exploit sandbox escape bugs to control iOS user mode system services and further attack the kernel.",

Vendors would always apply security measurements into the ARM Cortex M product for few major reasons: 1) People will not be able to copy and replicate the product; 2) License control for the hardware and software; 3) Prevent malicious code injection in to the firmware. Vendors normally rely on the security measurements built within the chip (unique ID number/signature) or security measurements built around the chip (secure boot).\nIn this talk, we will share the ARM Cortex M SOC vulnerability that we discovered and it will be two parts:\nThe first is security measurement build within the SOC and how we break it. We could gain control of changing the SOC unique ID and write the firmware or even turn the device into a trojan or bot.\nThe second is security measure built around the SOC and how we break the Secure Boot elements and write into the firmware.",

      "description": "Orwell's concept of 1984 has more to do with government misuse of technology than technology itself. New technology allows for more opportunity, but unchecked, it allows for complete government control. \nRepresentative Daniel Zolnikov is the nation's leading politician regarding privacy and surveillance and has enacted numerous laws safeguarding fourth amendment rights regarding digital communications and technology. Daniel will walk you down the road of how political misuse of technology can and will turn the Federal Government into an unprecedented nanny state that will lead to a suppressed free flow of information and fear of stepping out of line. His story includes insights on how unique left and right coalitions were formed to pass these laws in his home state of Montana, and how he prevailed against law enforcement groups who opposed implementing warrant requirements. \nThis discussion is aimed at sharing insights no matter your political affiliation. All of Daniel's legislation has passed with overwhelming bi-partisan support through both bodies in Montana's legislature and was signed by the governor of the opposite party. Although most speeches involving politicians tend to lead towards rhetoric, Daniel's goal is to share enough information to be able to understand why change has not taken place yet, and leave you understanding how to remedy that. \nHis story will give you insights into the politics that states and the nation face when reforming these issues, and his down to earth approach will bring the topic down to a level of humor and easy understanding. There is no need for any technical or political insight to be able to appreciate this topic and the work Daniel has done on behalf of the more technologically savvy enthusiasts. \nThe theme of DEF CON 26 would be inconsistent without taking into consideration policy and how it ties in closely with technology. Technology relies on policy, and policy has the implications of dictating the use of technology. The two can go hand in hand, or end up squaring up against each other. You are an important, and lesser heard voice in the world of aged politicians with limited vision. The Orwellian state existed due to a mixture of bad policies and technology. Although the theme focuses on technology used to disrupt the surveillance state, the other half of the battle is ensuring this state does not reach the disastrous conclusions of 1984. \nDaniel believes we can move forward with technology without living in fear of our government. If you want to have some hope and direction towards the future of policy regarding surveillance and technology, Daniel will leave you with the optimism that there is still a chance that our nation can have a balanced approach that ensures 1984 does not become the norm in the future and will help you understand how to take part in this action.",

      "description": "Penetration testers can have the tables turned on them by attackers, to the detriment of client and tester security. Vulnerabilities exist in widely-used penetration testing tools and procedures. Testing often takes place in hostile environments: across the public Internet, over wireless, and on client networks where attackers may already have a foothold. \nIn these environments, common penetration testing practices can be targeted by third-party attackers. This can compromise testing teams in the style of \"ihuntpineapples\", or worse: quietly and over a long period of time. The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of client networks is also put at risk by \"sloppy\" testing techniques.\nIn this workshop, we present a comprehensive set of recommendations that can be used to build secure penetration testing operations. This includes technical recommendations, policies, procedures, and guidance on how to communicate and work with client organizations about the risks and mitigations. The goal is to develop testing practices that:\n- ...are more professionally sound\n\n - ...protect client organizations\n\n - ...protect penetration testers' infrastructure, and\n\n - ...avoid a negative impact on speed, agility, and creativity of testers\nThe recommendations are illustrated with entertaining and informative hands-on exercises. For the DEF CON 26 version of this class, the exercises have been updated to take place within Docker containers, and a portion of the class will involve introducing penetration testers to the use (and abuse) of containers. \nExercises include:\n\n - Vulnerability analysis of a penetration testing device's firmware\n\n - Quick and dirty code audits of high-risk testing tools\n\n - Monitoring and hijacking post-exploitation command and control\n\n - Layering security around otherwise insecure tools.\nAfter this workshop, you will walk away with actionable recommendations for improving the maturity and security of your penetration testing operations, as well as an exposure to the technical aspects of protecting the confidentiality of sensitive client data. You will participate in hands-on exercises that illustrate the importance of analyzing your own tools for vulnerabilities, and learn how to think like an attacker that hunts attackers. You'll hear about the challenges that are inherent in performing penetration tests on sensitive client networks, and learn how to layer security around your practices to reduce the risks.",

      "description": "Big Data have been for quiet a good time the driving force for innovation in many markets around. Data is the current asset that companies from around the world look for to crunch and extract information and knowledge, get new insights in order to create new services and products to deliver to their customers and finally improve their profits.\nBecause of that, it is imperative to protect such an important asset. In this workshop we will look at Haddoop from the point of view of security. We will learn what the Hadoop ecosystem has to offer us to protect our data, starting with Kerberos, perimeter security with Apache Knox, Configuring authorization with Apache Ranger and enabling encryption of the HDFS (Hadoop File System).\n1) Kerberos is used in Hadoop to provide an authentication system for users and other system interacting with the Hadoop cluster and it's services. Strongly authenticating and establishing a user's identity is the basis for secure access in Hadoop. Users need to be able to reliably \"identify\" themselves and then have that identity propagated throughout the Hadoop cluster. Hadoop uses Kerberos as the basis for strong authentication and identity propagation for both user and services. More info: https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/\n2) The Apache Knox Gateway (Knox) is a system to extend the reach of Apache Hadoop services to users outside of a Hadoop cluster without reducing Hadoop Security. Knox also simplifies Hadoop security for users who access the cluster data and execute jobs. The Knox Gateway is designed as a reverse proxy. The Apache Knox Gateway is an Application Gateway for interacting with the REST APIs and UIs of Apache Hadoop deployments. The Knox Gateway provides a single access point for all REST and HTTP interactions with Apache Hadoop clusters. More info: https://knox.apache.org/\n3) Apache Ranger is a framework to enable, monitor and manage comprehensive data security across the Hadoop platform. The vision with Ranger is to provide comprehensive security across the Apache Hadoop ecosystem",

In this 4 hour workshop we will learn the limitation of this enforcement and practice how we can bypass it. We will explore 4 different methods (from very easy to difficult) on various versions of Windows, including Windows 10. We will see how and why they work, and which malware used them in the past.\nFirst we will see how we can use leaked certificates to overcome DSE as well as how we can turn it OFF by design, and what are its limitations. Then we will use WinDBG to look into the kernel and find the various flags used to control DSE and use the HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver to do kernel exploitation for setting those to the value we require.

      "description": "In recent years malscripts and file based exploits have become a main delivery method for malware. Malscripts are often heavily obfuscated and they can take many different forms including WScript, Javascript, macros, and PowerShell. There has also been been a rise in document based exploits used to deliver and execute these malscripts. As a result incident responders and malware analysts need to be comfortable analyzing different document formats, identifying potential exploits, and analyze malscripts.\nIn this workshop you will work through the triage of a live malware delivery chain that includes a malicious document, malicious scripts, and a final malware payload. During this process you will be exposed to different document based exploits, and you will practice the skills required to manually analyze malscripts. This workshop focuses on the fundamental analysis techniques used when identifying, deobfuscating, and analyzing maldocs and malscripts. However, we will also provide an introduction to automation tools and techniques that can be used to speed up the analysis process. \nThis workshop is aimed at junior incident responders, hobby malware analysts, and general security or IT practitioners who are interested in learning more about the malware triage process. If you have no experience with malware analysis but you have a good understanding of scripting languages like VBScript, and Javascript, and you are familiar with windows internals you should have no problem completing the workshop. You will be provided with a VirtualMachine to use during the workshop, please make sure to bring a laptop that meets the following requirements. Your laptop must have VirtualBox installed and working (VMWare is not supported). Your laptop must have at least 60GB of disk space free, preferably 100GB. Your laptop must be able to mount USB storage devices. Make sure you have the appropriate dongle if you need one.",

We also don't want anybody to know that we're sending any data. That's the hard part. The observation of our presence on the network could be enough to get us in trouble. And that's just not acceptable. We need to figure out a way to hide in plain sight.\nCreating an environment where data can be sent securely and our presence on the network is hidden, is not an easy thing to do. We can't rely on centralized technologies, which means we need to build a decentralized network. The network should be adaptive and flexible enough to send any type of data to any number of users. But how do we inject anonymity into a network while still supporting the verification of identity between parties? Can we establish trust without having to trust?\nThis workshop takes you through the process of creating a decentralized network that allows you to circumvent detection by governments and corporations. You'll be able to securely communicate and share data while masking your online identity. You'll create an adaptive, node-based infrastructure where data is shared via Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) backed by real-time asymmetric Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC). If you've ever wanted to punch a hole through a great (or not-so-great) firewall, this workshop is for you.\nPlease note that this is a medium-level, technical workshop and requires that attendees have prior experience in at least one programming language, preferably C or C++.

Have you ever wanted to know how to make a train derail, or stop a production line? Well, this workshop is made for you!\nThe goal of this workshop is to give you the knowledge required to start attacking SCADA networks and PLCs, and give you hands-on experience on real devices by hacking our model train!\nIn this workshop, we will cover the main components and the commonly associated security flaws of industrial control systems, aka SCADA systems. We will then focus on their key assets, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), and discover how they work, how they communicate, how they can be programmed to learn the methods and tools you can use to p*wn them.\nThen we will move on to real-world by attacking real PLCs from two major manufacturers on a dedicated setup featuring robot arms and a model train! Let's capture the flag!",

One perspective is that of security testing in a Continuous Delivery Pipeline (as part of CI/CD) and the other is the perspective of a Penetration Tester. In a CI/CD Pipeline, one would like security tests to be triggered in an automated manner. These tests should provide information related to application vulnerabilities to engineering teams, early in the SDL (Software Development Lifecycle), preferably before these apps are deployed to production. From the perspective of the Pentester, there is the obvious shortage of time and resources. Pentesters spend a lot of time repeating standard manual processes, thereby losing out on time to perform more deep, insightful analysis of the target application to uncover serious security flaws. Targeted Automation, can be very useful for a Pentester as well.",

The input dataset is analyzed to collect various attributes which are then arranged in a number of feature vectors. These vectors are then individually visualized, indexed and then queried for each new input file. Matching vectors are labelled as per their AV detection categories for now but this could be changed to a heuristics approach if needed. If dynamic behavior or network traffic details are available, vectors are also converted into activity graphs that depict evolution of activity with a predefined time scale. This results into an animation of malware/malware category's behavior traits and is also useful in identifying activity overlaps across the input dataset.\n\n\nMalware detection is a challenging task as the landscape is ever-evolving. Every other day, a new variant or a known malware family is reported and signature driven tools race against time to add detection. The process worsens when the rate of incoming samples is in thousands on a daily basis, making static/dynamic analysis alone of no use.\n\n\nAngad tries to address this issue by leveraging well-known data classification techniques to the malware domain.

      "description": "Deception techniques - if deployed well - can be very effective for organizations to improve network defense and can be a useful arsenal for blue teams to detect attacks at very early stage of cyber kill chain. But the challenge we have seen is deploying, managing and administering decoys across large networks. Although there are lot of commercial tools in this space, we haven't come across open source tools which can achieve this.\n\n\nWith this in mind, we have developed DejaVu which is an open source deception framework which can be used to deploy, configure and administer decoys centrally across the infrastructure. A web-based management console can be used by the defender to deploy multiple interactive decoys (HTTP Servers,SQL,SMB,FTP,SSH,client side\u2013NBNS) strategically across their network on different VLANs. Logging and alerting dashboard displays detailed information about the alerts generated and can be further configured to generate high accuracy alert; and how these alerts should be handled.\n\n\nDecoys can also be placed on the client VLANs to detect client side attacks such as responder/LLMNR attacks using client side decoys. Additionally, common attacks which the adversary uses to compromise such as abusing Tomcat/SQL server for initial foothold can be deployed as decoys, luring the attacker and enabling detection.",

To illustrate how fast this tool is, here's an example of how to setup and execute a credential stealing evil twin attack against a WPA2-EAP network in just two commands:\n\n\n # generate certificates\n\n./eaphammer --cert-wizard\n\n\n# launch attack\n\n./eaphammer -i wlan0 --channel 4 --auth wpa --essid CorpWifi --creds\n\n\nEAPHammer\u2019s userbase has doubled since its debut in early 2017, and the project has matured substantially to meet this demand. It is now the first rogue AP attack tool to offer out-of-the-box support for attacks against 802.11n/ac. Most of the added complexity associated with these protocols is managed automatically by EAPHammer.\n\n We\u2019ve also added some cool feature like Hashcat support, Karma, and SSID cloaking, as well as an extended UI and config management system for advanced users who require granular control over their rogue access points.\n\n \nTo check out the codebase, head to \nhttps://github.com/s0lst1c3/eaphammer",

Hardware sold out, FPGA support was introduced and devices are once again available! We will demonstrate how to take total control of still vulnerable systems via PCIe DMA code injection. Kernels will be subverted, full disk encryption defeated and shells spawned! Processes will be enumerated and their virtual memory abused - all by using affordable hardware and the open source PCILeech toolkit.",

The \"mapping\" functionality is sort of like nmap for wifi - it lists all wifi networks nearby, and under each network it lists all the clients connected to that network. The \"trigger\" functionality allows users to do things like \"if this device sends more than 10000 bytes in 30 seconds, do something\". It also includes a powerful Python plugin system that makes it simple to write plugins to do things like \"if I see an Apple device with a power level greater than -40dBm, deauth it\". If you want to do any sort of wifi recon/monitoring/hacking, trackerjacker will almost certainly make the job easier!",

      "description": "Nowadays, security threats and cyber-attacks against ICS assets, became a topic of public interest worldwide. Within this demo, will be presented how HID attacks can still be used by threat actors to compromise industrial air-gapped environments.\nWHID Injector was born from the need for a cheap and dedicated hardware that could be remotely controlled in order to conduct HID attacks. WHID's core is mainly an Atmega 32u4 (commonly used in many Arduino boards) and an ESP-12s (which provides the WiFi capabilities and is commonly used in IoT projects).\nNontheless, during the last months, a new hardware was under R&D (i.e. WHID-Elite). It replaces the Wi-Fi capabilities with a 2G baseband, which gives unlimited operational range.\n\nThis cute piece of hardware is perfect to be concealed into USB gadgets and used during engagements to get remote shell over an air-gapped environment. In practice, is the \"wet dream\" of any ICS Red Teamer out there.\n\nDuring the demo we will see in depth how WHID and WHID-Elite were designed and their functionalities. We will also look at which tools and techniques Blue Teams can use to detect and mitigate this kind of attacks.",
