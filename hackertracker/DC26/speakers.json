In her recent publication in Science, she demonstrated how semantics derived from language corpora contain human-like biases. In addition, she developed novel privacy attacks to de-anonymize programmers using code stylometry. Her presentations on both de-anonymization and bias in machine learning are the recipients of best talk awards. Her work on semi-automated anonymization of writing style furthermore received the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium Best Paper Award.

Previously he participated in a cooperation between ELTE Department of Meteorology and the Paks Nuclear Power Plant Ltd., the goal of which was to develop TREX, a toxic waste emission simulator using CUDA. \nThe scene from RoboCop where Nikko defeats the ED-209 with just a laptop and a serial cable made a huge impression on him, and after seeing the movie, his path was set: he was bound to be a hacker. His first experiences in this field involved poking around various copy protection schemes, and to this day his favorite areas of expertise are the ones that require some mangling of binary files. Besides computer security he also loves mountain biking, flight simulators, and builds and flies acro quadcopters.",

He is a member of the Mandiant/FireEye applied research team, where he researches and builds sweet incident response software. Recently, he's mostly been hacking with Python, Jupyter, C, and Machine Learning. Though only recently getting into the security space professionally, Caleb has been into security for a while - in high school, he wrote his own (bad) cryptography and steganography software. In college, he did a good bit of \"informal pen testing\". These days, he has fun doing a lot of Radio/Wireless hacking, and using Machine Learning/Math to do cool security-related things.\n",
