Thankfully, that wasn't as ridiculous as it sounded, and it turned out that L0phtCrack would be kind of a big deal. He's still the primary maintainer of the codebase today, 20 years later. Also at L0pht and @stake, he developed AntiSniff, a promiscuous-mode device detection system, wrote a bunch of security advisories, and developed a fine cDc-brand remote administration tool named Back Orifice 2000. Also at L0pht and throughout the @stake acquisition, he developed an automated software decompilation system that would become the core of the static analysis technology for the startup he and Chris Wysopal would found in 2006, Veracode.",

Recently, he's mostly been hacking with Python, Jupyter, C, and Machine Learning. Though only recently getting into the security space professionally, Caleb has been into security for a while - in high school, he wrote his own (bad) cryptography and steganography software. In college, he did a good bit of \"informal pen testing\". These days, he has fun doing a lot of Radio/Wireless hacking, and using Machine Learning/Math to do cool security-related things.\n",
